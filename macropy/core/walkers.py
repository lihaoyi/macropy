"""Implementation of Walkers, a nice way of transforming and traversing ASTs."""

from macropy.core import *

class Walker(object):
    """
    @Walker decorates a function of the form:

    @Walker
    def transform(tree, **kw):
        ...
        return new_tree


    Which is used via:

    new_tree = transform.recurse(old_tree, initial_ctx)
    new_tree = transform.recurse(old_tree)
    new_tree, collected = transform.recurse_collect(old_tree, initial_ctx)
    new_tree, collected = transform.recurse_collect(old_tree)
    collected = transform.collect(old_tree, initial_ctx)
    collected = transform.collect(old_tree)

    The `transform` function takes the tree to be transformed, in addition to
    a set of `**kw` which provides additional functionality:


    - `set_ctx`: this is a function, used via `set_ctx(name=value)` anywhere in
      `transform`, which will cause any children of `tree` to receive `name` as
      an argument with a value `value.
    - `set_ctx_for`: this is similar to `set_ctx`, but takes an additional
      parameter `tree` (i.e. `set_ctx_for(tree, name=value)`) and `name` is
      only injected into the parameter list of `transform` when `tree` is the
      AST snippet being transformed.
    - `collect`: this is a function used via `collect(thing)`, which adds
      `thing` to the `collected` list returned by `recurse_collect`.
    - `stop`: when called via `stop()`, this prevents recursion on children
      of the current tree.

    These additional arguments can be declared in the signature, e.g.:

    @Walker
    def transform(tree, ctx, set_ctx, **kw):
        ... do stuff with ctx ...
        set_ctx(...)
        return new_tree

    for ease of use.
