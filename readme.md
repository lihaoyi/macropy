MacroPy 1.0.3
=============
**MacroPy** is an implementation of [Syntactic Macros](http://tinyurl.com/cmlls8v) in the [Python Programming Language](http://python.org/). MacroPy provides a mechanism for user-defined functions (macros) to perform transformations on the [abstract syntax tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST) of a Python program at _import time_. This is an easy way to enhance the semantics of a Python program in ways which are otherwise impossible, for example providing an extremely concise way of declaring classes:

```python
>>> import macropy.console
0=[]=====> MacroPy Enabled <=====[]=0
>>> from macropy.case_classes import macros, case

>>> @case
class Point(x, y): pass

>>> p = Point(1, 2)
>>> print p.x
1
>>> print p
Point(1, 2)
```

Try it out in the REPL, it should just work! You can also see the [docs/examples/using_macros](docs/examples/using_macros) folder for a minimal example of using MacroPy's existing macros.

MacroPy has been used to implement features such as:

- [Case Classes](#case-classes), easy Algebraic Data Types from Scala, and [Enums](#enums)
- [Quick Lambdas](#quick-lambdas) from Scala and Groovy, and the [Lazy](#lazy) and [Interned](#interned) utility macros
- [String Interpolation](#string-interpolation), a common feature in many programming languages
- [Tracing](#tracing) and [Smart Asserts](#smart-asserts), and [show_expanded](#show_expanded), to help in the debugging effort
- [MacroPEG](#macropeg-parser-combinators), Parser Combinators inspired by Scala's

As well as a number of more experimental macros such as:

- [Pattern Matching](#pattern-matching) from the Functional Programming world
- [Tail-call Optimization](#tail-call-optimization), preventing unnecessary stack overflows
- [PINQ to SQLAlchemy](#pinq-to-sqlalchemy), a shameless clone of LINQ to SQL from C#
- [Pyxl Snippets](#pyxl-snippets), XML interpolation within your Python code
- [JS Snippets](#js-snippets), cross compiling snippets of Python into equivalent Javascript

MacroPy is tested to run on [CPython 2.7.2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython) and [PyPy 2.0](http://pypy.org/), but with only partial support for Python 3.X (You'll need to clone the [python3 branch](https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy/tree/python3) yourself) and no support for [Jython](http://www.jython.org/). MacroPy is also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MacroPy), using a standard [setup.py](setup.py) to manage dependencies, installation and other things. Check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lihaoyi/5577609) for an example of setting it up on a clean system.

30,000ft Overview
=================
Macro functions are defined in three ways:

```python
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def my_expr_macro(tree, **kw):
    ...
    return new_tree

@macros.block
def my_block_macro(tree, **kw):
    ...
    return new_tree

@macros.decorator
def my_decorator_macro(tree, **kw):
    ...
    return new_tree
```

The line `macros = Macros()` is required to mark the file as providing macros, and the `macros` object then provides the methods `expr`, `block` and `decorator` which can be used to decorate functions to mark them out as the three different kinds of macros.

Each macro function is passed a `tree`. The `tree` is an `AST` object, the sort provided by Python's [ast module](http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html). The macro is able to do whatever transformations it wants, and it returns a modified (or even an entirely new) `AST` object which MacroPy will use to replace the original macro invocation. The macro also takes `**kw`, which contains [other useful things](#arguments) which you may need.

These three types of macros are called via:

```python
from my_macro_module import macros, my_expr_macro, my_block_macro, my_decorator_macro

val = my_expr_macro[...]

with my_block_macro:
    ...

@my_decorator_macro
class X():
    ...
```

Where the line `from my_macro_module import macros, ...` is necessary to tell MacroPy which macros these module relies on. Multiple things can be imported from each module, but `macros` must come first for macros from that module to be used.

Any time any of these syntactic forms is seen, if a matching macro exists in any of the packages from which `macros` has been imported from, the abstract syntax tree captured by these forms (the `...` in the code above) is given to the respective macro to handle. The tree (new, modified, or even unchanged) which the macro returns is substituted into the original code in-place.

MacroPy intercepts the module-loading workflow, via the functionality provided by [PEP 302: New Import Hooks](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/). The workflow is roughly:

- Intercept an import
- Parse the contents of the file into an AST
- Walk the AST and expand any macros that it finds
- Compile the modified AST and resume loading it as a module

![Workflow](docs/media/Workflow.png)

Note that this means **you cannot use macros in a file that is run directly**, as it will not be passed through the import hooks. Hence the minimum viable setup is:

```python
# run.py
import macropy.activate     # sets up macro import hooks
import other                # imports other.py and passes it through import hooks


# my_macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

... define some macros ...


# other.py
from macropy.macros.my_macro_module import macros, ...

... do stuff with macros ...
```

Where you run `run.py` instead of `other.py`. For the same reason, you cannot directly run MacroPy's own unit tests directly using `unittest` or `nose`: you need to run the [macropy/run_tests.py](macropy/run_tests.py) file from the project root for the tests to run. See the [runnable, self-contained no-op example](docs/examples/nop) to see exactly what this looks like, or the example for [using existing macros](docs/examples/using_macros).

MacroPy also works in the REPL:

```python
PS C:\Dropbox\Workspace\macropy> python
Python 2.7 (r27:82525, Jul  4 2010, 07:43:08) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import macropy.console
0=[]=====> MacroPy Enabled <=====[]=0
>>> from macropy.tracing import macros, trace
>>> trace[[x*2 for x in range(3)]]
range(3) -> [0, 1, 2]
x*2 -> 0
x*2 -> 2
x*2 -> 4
x*2 for x in range(3) -> [0, 2, 4]
[0, 2, 4]
```

This example demonstrates the usage of the [Tracing](#tracing) macro, which helps trace the evaluation of a Python expression. Although support for the REPL is still experimental, most examples on this page will work when copied and pasted into the REPL verbatim. MacroPy also works in the PyPy and [IPython](http://ipython.org/) REPLs.

Demo Macros
===========
Below are a few example uses of macros that are implemented (together with test cases!) in the [macropy](macropy) and [macropy/experimental](macropy/experimental) folders. These are also the ideal places to go look at to learn to write your own macros: check out the source code of the [String Interpolation](macropy/string_interp.py) or [Quick Lambda](macropy/quick_lambda.py) macros for some small (<30 lines), self contained examples. Their [unit](macropy/test/string_interp.py) [tests](macropy/test/quick_lambda.py) demonstrate how these macros are used.

Feel free to open up a REPL and try out the examples in the console; simply `import macropy.console`, and most of the examples should work right off the bat when pasted in! Macros in this section are also relatively stable and well-tested, and you can rely on them to work and not to suddenly change from version to version (as much as can be said for a two-month-old project!).

Case Classes
------------
```python
from macropy.case_classes import macros, case

@case
class Point(x, y): pass

p = Point(1, 2)

print str(p) # Point(1, 2)
print p.x    # 1
print p.y    # 2
print Point(1, 2) == Point(1, 2) # True
x, y = p
print x, y   # 1 2
```

[Case classes](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/case-classes-are-cool) are classes with extra goodies:

- Nice `__str__` and `__repr__` methods autogenerated
- An autogenerated constructor
- Structural equality by default
- A copy-constructor, for creating modified copies of instances
- A `__slots__` declaration, to improve memory efficiency
- An `__iter__` method, to allow destructuring

The reasoning being that although you may sometimes want complex, custom-built classes with custom features and fancy inheritance, very (very!) often you want a simple class with a constructor, pretty `__str__` and `__repr__` methods, and structural equality which doesn't inherit from anything. Case classes provide you just that, with an extremely concise declaration:

```python
@case
class Point(x, y): pass
```

As opposed to the equivalent class, written manually:

```python
class Point(object):
    __slots__ = ['x', 'y']
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return "Point(" + self.x + ", " + self.y + ")"

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.__str__()

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return not self.__eq__(other)

    def __iter__(self, other):
        yield self.x
        yield self.y
```

Whew, what a lot of boilerplate! This is clearly a pain to do, error prone to deal with, and violates [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) in an extreme way: each member of the class (`x` and `y` in this case) has to be repeated _8 times_, with loads and loads of boilerplate. It is also *buggy*, and will fail at runtime when the above example is run, so see if you can spot the bug in it! Given how tedious writing all this code is, it is no surprise that most python classes do not come with proper `__str__` or useful `__eq__` functions! With case classes, there is no excuse, since all this will be generated for you.

Case classes also provide a convenient *copy-constructor*, which creates a shallow copy of the case class with modified fields, leaving the original unchanged:

```python
a = Point(1, 2)
b = a.copy(x = 3)
print a # Point(1, 2)
print b # Point(3, 2)
```

Like any other class, a case class may contain methods in its body:

```python
@case
class Point(x, y):
    def length(self):
        return (self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2) ** 0.5

print Point(3, 4).length() # 5.0
```

or class variables. The only restrictions are that only the `__init__`, `__repr__`, `___str__`, `__eq__` methods will be set for you, and the initializer/class body and inheritance are treated specially.

### Body Initializer
```python
@case
class Point(x, y):
    self.length = (self.x**2 + self.y**2) ** 0.5

print Point(3, 4).length # 5
```

Case classes allow you to add initialization logic by simply placing the initialization statements in the class body: any statements within the class body which are not class or function definitions are taken to be part of the initializer, and so you can use e.g. the `self` variable to set instance members just like in a normal `__init__` method.

Any additional assignments to `self.XXX` in the body of the class scope are detected and the `XXX` added to the class' `__slots__` declaration, meaning you generally don't need to worry about `__slots__` limiting what you can do with the class. As long as there is an assignment to the member somewhere in the class' body, it will be added to slots. This means if you try to set a member of an instance via `my_thing.XXX = ...` somewhere else, but aren't setting it anywhere in the class' body, it will fail with an AttributeError. The solution to this is to simply add a `self.XXX = None` in the class body, which will get picked up and added to its `__slots__`.

The body initializer also means you cannot set *class* members on a case class, as it any bare assignments `XXX = ...` will get treated as a local variable assignment in the scope of the class' `__init__` method. This is one of [several limitations](#limitations).

### Defaults, `*args` and `**kwargs`

Case classes also provide a syntax for default values:

```python
@case
class Point(x | 0, y | 0):
    pass

print str(Point(y = 5)) # Point(0, 5)
```

For `*args`:

```python
@case
class PointArgs(x, y, [rest]):
    pass

print PointArgs(3, 4, 5, 6, 7).rest # (5, 6, 7)
```

and `**kwargs`:

```python
@case
class PointKwargs(x, y, {rest}):
    pass

print PointKwargs(1, 2, a=1, b=2).rest # {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

All these behave as you would expect, and can be combined in all the normal ways. The strange syntax (rather than the normal `x=0`, `*args` or `**kwargs`) is due to limitations in the Python 2.7 grammar, which are removed in Python 3.3.

### Inheritance
Instead of manual inheritance, inheritance for case classes is defined by _nesting_, as shown below:

```python
@case
class List():
    def __len__(self):
        return 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter([])

    class Nil:
        pass

    class Cons(head, tail):
        def __len__(self):
            return 1 + len(self.tail)

        def __iter__(self):
            current = self

            while len(current) > 0:
                yield current.head
                current = current.tail

print isinstance(List.Cons(None, None), List)    # True
print isinstance(List.Nil(), List)               # True

my_list = List.Cons(1, List.Cons(2, List.Cons(3, List.Nil())))
empty_list = List.Nil()

print my_list.head              # 1
print my_list.tail              # List.Cons(2, List.Cons(3, List.Nil()))
print len(my_list)              # 5
print sum(iter(my_list))        # 6
print sum(iter(empty_list))     # 0
```

This is an implementation of a singly linked [cons list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons), providing both `head` and `tail` ([LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP)'s `car` and `cdr`) as well as the ability to get the `len` or `iter` for the list.

As the classes `Nil` are `Cons` are nested within `List`, both of them get transformed into case  classes which inherit from it. This nesting can go arbitrarily deep.

### Overriding

Except for the `__init__` method, all the methods provided by case classes are inherited from `macropy.case_classes.CaseClass`, and can thus be overriden, with the overriden method still accessible via the normal mechanisms:

```python
from macropy.case_classes import CaseClass

@case
class Point(x, y):
    def __str__(self):
        return "mooo " + CaseClass.__str__(self)

print Point(1, 2) # mooo Point(1, 2)
```

The `__init__` method is generated, not inherited. For the common case of adding additional initialization steps after the assignment of arguments to members, you can use the [body initializer](#body-initializer) described above. However, if you want a different modification (e.g. changing the number of arguments) you can achieve this by manually defining your own `__init__` method:

```python
@case
class Point(x, y):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.x = value
        self.y = value


print Point(1) # mooo Point(1, 1)
```

You cannot access the replaced `__init__` method, due to fact that it's generated, not inherited. Nevertheless, this provides additional flexibility in the case where you really need it.

### Limitations
Case classes provide a lot of functionality to the user, but come with their own set of limitations:

- **No class members**: a consequence of the [body initializer](#body-initializer), you cannot assign class variables in the body of a class via the `foo = ...` syntax. However, `@static` and `@class` methods work fine
- **Restricted inheritance**: A case class only inherits from `macropy.case_classes.CaseClass`, as well as any case classes it is lexically scoped within. There is no way to express any other form of inheritance
- **__slots__**: case classes get `__slots__` declarations by default. Thus you cannot assign ad-hoc members which are not defined in the class signature (the `class Point(x, y)` line).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, case classes are similar to Python's [`namedtuple`](http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple), but far more flexible (methods, inheritance, etc.), and provides the programmer with a much better experience (e.g. no arguments-as-space-separated-string definition). Unlike `namedtuple`s, they are flexible enough that they can be used to replace a large fraction of user defined classes, rather than being relegated to niche uses.

In the cases where you desperately need additional flexibility [not afforded](#limitations) by case classes, you can always fall back on normal Python classes and do without the case class functionality.

Enums
-----
```python
from macropy.case_classes import macros, enum

@enum
class Direction:
    North, South, East, West

print Direction(name="North") # Direction.North

print Direction.South.name    # South

print Direction(id=2)         # Direction.East

print Direction.West.id       # 3

print Direction.North.next    # Direction.South
print Direction.West.prev     # Direction.East

print Direction.all
# [Direction.North, Direction.East, Direction.South, Direction.West]
```

MacroPy also provides an implementation of [Enumerations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type), heavily inspired by the [Java implementation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html) and built upon [Case Classes](#case-classes). These are effectively case classes with

- A fixed set of instances
- Auto-generated `name`, `id`, `next` and `prev` fields
- Auto-generated `all` list, which enumerates all instances.
- A `__new__` method that retrieves an existing instance, rather than creating new ones

Note that instances of an Enum cannot be created manually: calls such as `Direction(name="North")` or `Direction(id=2)` attempt to retrieve an existing Enum with that property, throwing an exception if there is none. This means that reference equality is always used to compare instances of Enums for equality, allowing for much faster equality checks than if you had used [Case Classes](#case-classes).

### Definition of Instances
The instances of an Enum can be declared on a single line, as in the example above, or they can be declared on subsequent lines:

```python
@enum
class Direction:
    North
    South
    East
    West
```

or in a mix of the two styles:

```python
@enum
class Direction:
    North, South
    East, West
```

The basic rule here is that the body of an Enum can only contain bare names, function calls (show below), tuples of these, or function defs: no other statements are allowed. In turn the bare names and function calls are turned into instances of the Enum, while function defs (shown later) are turned into their methods. This also means that unlike [Case Classes](#case-classes), Enums cannot have [body initializers](#body-initializer).

### Complex Enums
```python
@enum
class Direction(alignment, continents):
    North("Vertical", ["Northrend"])
    East("Horizontal", ["Azeroth", "Khaz Modan", "Lordaeron"])
    South("Vertical", ["Pandaria"])
    West("Horizontal", ["Kalimdor"])

    @property
    def opposite(self):
        return Direction(id=(self.id + 2) % 4)

    def padded_name(self, n):
        return ("<" * n) + self.name + (">" * n)

# members
print Direction.North.alignment # Vertical
print Direction.East.continent  # ["Azeroth", "Khaz Modan", "Lordaeron"]

# properties
print Direction.North.opposite  # Direction.South

# methods
print Direction.South.padded_name(2) # <<South>>
```

Enums are not limited to the auto-generated members shown above. Apart from the fact that Enums have no constructor, and no body initializer, they can contain fields, methods and properties just like [Case Classes](#case-classes) do. This allows you to associate arbitrary data with each instance of the Enum, and have them perform as full-fledged objects rather than fancy integers.

Quick Lambdas
-------------
```python
from macropy.quick_lambda import macros, f, _

print map(f[_ + 1], [1, 2, 3])    # [2, 3, 4]
print reduce(f[_ * _], [1, 2, 3]) # 6
```

Macropy provides a syntax for lambda expressions similar to Scala's [anonymous functions](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/quick-explanation-of-scalas-syntax). Essentially, the transformation is:

```python
f[_ * _] -> lambda a, b: a * b
```

where the underscores get replaced by identifiers, which are then set to be the parameters of the enclosing `lambda`. This works too:

```python
print map(f[_.split(' ')[0]], ["i am cow", "hear me moo"])
# ['i', 'hear']
```

Quick Lambdas can be also used as a concise, lightweight, more-readable substitute for `functools.partial`

```python
from macropy.quick_lambda import macros, f
basetwo = f[int(_, base=2)]
print basetwo('10010') # 18
```

is equivalent to

```python
import functools
basetwo = functools.partial(int, base=2)
print basetwo('10010') # 18
```

Quick Lambdas can also be used entirely without the `_` placeholders, in which case they wrap the target in a no argument `lambda: ...` thunk:

```python
from random import random
thunk = f[random() * 2 + 3]
print thunk() # 4.522011062548173
print thunk() # 4.894243231792029
```

This cuts out reduces the number of characters needed to make a thunk from 7 (using `lambda`) to 2, making it much easier to use thunks to do things like emulating [by name parameters](http://locrianmode.blogspot.com/2011/07/scala-by-name-parameter.html). The implementation of quicklambda is about [30 lines of code](macropy/quick_lambda.py), and is worth a look if you want to see how a simple (but extremely useful!) macro can be written.

Lazy
----
```python
from macropy.quick_lambda import macros, lazy

# count how many times expensive_func runs
count = [0]
def expensive_func():
    count[0] += 1

thunk = lazy[expensive_func()]

print count[0] # 0

thunk()
print count[0] # 1
thunk()
print count[0] # 1
```

The `lazy` macro is used to create a memoizing thunk. Wrapping an expression with `lazy` creates a thunk which needs to be applied (e.g. `thunk()`) in order to get the value of the expression out. This macro then memoizes the result of that expression, such that subsequent calls to `thunk()` will not cause re-computation.

This macro is a tradeoff between declaring the value as a variable:

```python
var = expensive_func()
```

Which evaluates exactly once, even when not used, and declaring it as a function

```python
thunk = lambda: expensive_func()
```

Which no longer evaluates when not used, but now re-evaluates every single time. With `lazy`, you get an expression that evaluates 0 or 1 times. This way, you don't have to pay the cost of computation if it is not used at all (the problems with variables) or the cost of needlessly evaluating it more than once (the problem with lambdas).

This is handy to have if you know how to compute an expression in a local scope that may be used repeatedly later. It may depend on many local variables, for example, which would be inconvenient to pass along to the point at which you know whether the computation is necessary. This way, you can simply "compute" the lazy value and pass it along, just as you would compute the value normally, but with the benefit of only-if-necessary evaluation.

Interned
--------
```python
from macropy.quick_lambda import macros, interned

# count how many times expensive_func runs
count = [0]
def expensive_func():
    count[0] += 1

def func():
    return interned[expensive_func()]

print count[0] # 0
func()
print count[0] # 1
func()
print count[0] # 1
```

The `interned` macro is similar to the [Lazy](#lazy) macro in that the code within the `interned[...]` block is wrapped in a thunk and evaluated at most once. Unlike the `lazy` macro, however, `interned` does not created a memoizing thunk that you can pass around your program; instead, the memoization is done on a *per-use-site* basis.

As you can see in the example above, although `func` is called repeatedly, the `expensive_func()` call within the `interned` block is only ever evaluated once. This is handy in that it gives you a mechanism for memoizing a particular computation without worrying about finding a place to store the memoized values. It's just memoized globally (often what you want) while being scoped locally, which avoids polluting the global namespace with names only relevant to a single function (also often what you want).

String Interpolation
--------------------
```python
from macropy.string_interp import macros, s

a, b = 1, 2
print s["{a} apple and {b} bananas"]
# 1 apple and 2 bananas
```

Unlike the normal string interpolation in Python, MacroPy's string interpolation allows the programmer to specify the variables to be interpolated _inline_ inside the string. The macro `s` then takes the string literal

```python
"{a} apple and {b} bananas"
```

and expands it into the expression

```python
"%s apple and %s bananas" % (a, b)
```

Which is evaluated at run-time in the local scope, using whatever the values `a` and `b` happen to hold at the time. The contents of the `{...}` can be any arbitrary python expression, and is not limited to variable names:

```python
from macropy.string_interp import macros, s
A = 10
B = 5
print s["{A} + {B} = {A + B}"]
# 10 + 5 = 15
```

Tracing
-------
```python
from macropy.tracing import macros, log
log[1 + 2]
# 1 + 2 -> 3
# 3

log["omg" * 3]
# ('omg' * 3) -> 'omgomgomg'
# 'omgomgomg'
```

Tracing allows you to easily see what is happening inside your code. Many a time programmers have written code like

```python
print "value", value
print "sqrt(x)", sqrt(x)
```

and the `log()` macro (shown above) helps remove this duplication by automatically expanding `log(1 + 2)` into `wrap("(1 + 2)", (1 + 2))`. `wrap` then evaluates the expression, printing out the source code and final value of the computation.

In addition to simple logging, MacroPy provides the `trace()` macro. This macro not only logs the source and result of the given expression, but also the source and result of all sub-expressions nested within it:

```python
from macropy.tracing import macros, trace
trace[[len(x)*3 for x in ["omg", "wtf", "b" * 2 + "q", "lo" * 3 + "l"]]]
# "b" * 2 -> 'bb'
# "b" * 2 + "q" -> 'bbq'
# "lo" * 3 -> 'lololo'
# "lo" * 3 + "l" -> 'lololol'
# ["omg", "wtf", "b" * 2 + "q", "lo" * 3 + "l"] -> ['omg', 'wtf', 'bbq', 'lololol']
# len(x) -> 3
# len(x)*3 -> 9
# len(x) -> 3
# len(x)*3 -> 9
# len(x) -> 3
# len(x)*3 -> 9
# len(x) -> 7
# len(x)*3 -> 21
# [len(x)*3 for x in ["omg", "wtf", "b" * 2 + "q", "lo" * 3 + "l"]] -> [9, 9, 9, 21]
# [9, 9, 9, 21]
```

As you can see, `trace` logs the source and value of all sub-expressions that get evaluated in the course of evaluating the list comprehension.

Lastly, `trace` can be used as a block macro:


```python
from macropy.tracing import macros, trace
with trace:
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, 5):
        sum = sum + 5

# sum = 0
# for i in range(0, 5):
#     sum = sum + 5
# range(0, 5) -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# sum = sum + 5
# sum + 5 -> 5
# sum = sum + 5
# sum + 5 -> 10
# sum = sum + 5
# sum + 5 -> 15
# sum = sum + 5
# sum + 5 -> 20
# sum = sum + 5
# sum + 5 -> 25
```

Used this way, `trace` will print out the source code of every _statement_ that gets executed, in addition to tracing the evaluation of any expressions within those statements.

Apart from simply printing out the traces, you can also redirect the traces wherever you want by having a `log()` function in scope:

```python
result = []

def log(x):
    result.append(x)
```

The tracer uses whatever `log()` function it finds, falling back on printing only if none exists. Instead of printing, this `log()` function appends the traces to a list, and is used in our unit tests.

We think that tracing is an extremely useful macro. For debugging what is happening, for teaching newbies how evaluation of expressions works, or for a myriad of other purposes, it is a powerful tool. The fact that it can be written as a [<100 line macro](macropy/tracing.py) is a bonus.

### Smart Asserts
```python
from macropy.tracing import macros, require
require[3**2 + 4**2 != 5**2]
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
#   File "macropy.tracing.py", line 67, in handle
#     raise AssertionError("Require Failed\n" + "\n".join(out))
# AssertionError: Require Failed
# 3**2 -> 9
# 4**2 -> 16
# 3**2 + 4**2 -> 25
# 5**2 -> 25
# 3**2 + 4**2 != 5**2 -> False
```

MacroPy provides a variant on the `assert` keyword called `require(`. Like `assert`, `require` throws an `AssertionError` if the condition is false.

Unlike `assert`, `require` automatically tells you what code failed the condition, and traces all the sub-expressions within the code so you can more easily see what went wrong. Pretty handy!

`require can also be used in block form:

```python
from macropy.tracing import macros, require
with require:
    a > 5
    a * b == 20
    a < 2

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<console>", line 4, in <module>
#   File "macropy.tracing.py", line 67, in handle
#     raise AssertionError("Require Failed\n" + "\n".join(out))
# AssertionError: Require Failed
# a < 2 -> False
```

This requires every statement in the block to be a boolean expression. Each expression will then be wrapped in a `require()`, throwing an `AssertionError` with a nice trace when a condition fails.

### `show_expanded`

```python
from ast import *
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q
from macropy.tracing import macros, show_expanded

print show_expanded[q[1 + 2]]
# BinOp(left=Num(n=1), op=Add(), right=Num(n=2))
```

`show_expanded` is a macro which is similar to the simple `log` macro shown above, but prints out what the wrapped code looks like *after all macros have been expanded*. This makes it extremely useful for debugging macros, where you need to figure out exactly what your code is being expanded into. `show_expanded` also works in block form:

```python
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q
from macropy.tracing import macros, show_expanded, trace

with show_expanded:
    a = 1
    b = q[1 + 2]
    with q as code:
        print a

# a = 1
# b = BinOp(left=Num(n=1), op=Add(), right=Num(n=2))
# code = [Print(dest=None, values=[Name(id='a', ctx=Load())], nl=True)]
```

These examples show how the [quasiquote](#quasiquotes) macro works: it turns an expression or block of code into its AST, assigning the AST to a variable at runtime for other code to use.

Here is a less trivial example: [case classes](#case-classes) are a pretty useful macro, which saves us the hassle of writing a pile of boilerplate ourselves. By using `show_expanded`, we can see what the case class definition expands into:

```python
from macropy.case_classes import macros, case
from macropy.tracing import macros, show_expanded

with show_expanded:
    @case
    class Point(x, y):
        pass

# class Point(CaseClass):
#     def __init__(self, x, y):
#         self.x = x
#         self.y = y
#         pass
#     _fields = ['x', 'y']
#     _varargs = None
#     _kwargs = None
#     __slots__ = ['x', 'y']
```

Pretty neat!

MacroPEG is an implementation of [Parser Combinators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator), an approach to building recursive descent parsers, when the task is too large for [regexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex) but yet too small for the heavy-duty [parser generators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators). MacroPEG is inspired by Scala's [parser combinator library](http://www.suryasuravarapu.com/2011/04/scala-parser-combinators-win.html), utilizing python macros to make the syntax as clean as possible .

The above example describes a simple parser for arithmetic expressions, which roughly follows the [PEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) syntax. Note how that in the example, the bulk of the code goes into the loop that reduces sequences of numbers and operators to a single number, rather than the recursive-descent parser itself!

Any assignment (`xxx = ...`) within a `with peg:` block is transformed into a `Parser`. A `Parser` comes with a `.parse(input)` method, which returns the parsed result if parsing succeeds and raises a `ParseError` in the case of failure. The `ParseError` contains a nice human-readable string detailing exactly what went wrong.

```python
json_exp.parse('{"omg": "123", "wtf": , "bbq": "789"}')
# ParseError: index: 22, line: 1, col: 23
# json_exp / obj / pair / json_exp
# {"omg": "123", "wtf": , "bbq": "789"}
#                       ^
# expected: (obj | array | string | true | false | null | number)
```

In addition to `.parse(input)`, a Parser also contains:
- `parse_string(input)`, a more program-friendly version of `parse` that returns successes and failures as boxed values (with metadata).
- a `parse_partial(input)` method, which is identical to `parse_string`, but does not require the entire `input` to be consumed, as long as some prefix of the `input` string matches. The `remaining` attribute of the `Success` indicates how far into the `input` string parsing proceeded.

### Basic Combinators

Parsers are generally built up from a few common building blocks. The fundamental atoms include:

- String literals like `'+'` match the input to their literal value (e.g. '+') and return it as the parse result, or fails if it does not match.
- Regexes like `'[0-9]+'.r` match the regex to the input if possible, and return it.
- Tuples like `('(', expr, ')')` match each of the elements within sequentially, and return a list containing the result of each element. It fails if any of its elements fails.
- Parsers separated by `|`, for example `'+' | '-' | '*' | '/'`, attempt to match each of the alternatives from left to right, and return the result of the first success.
- Parsers separated by `&`, for example `'[1234]'.r & '[3456]'.r`, require both parsers succeed, and return the result of the left side.
- `parser.rep` attempts to match the `parser` 0 or more times, returning a list of the results from each successful match.
- `-parser` negates the `parser`: if `parser` succeeded (with any result), `-parser` fails. If `parser` failed, `-parser` succeeds with the result `""`, the empty string.

Apart from the fundamental atoms, MacroPeg also provides combinators which are not strictly necessary, but are nevertheless generally useful in almost all parsing scenarios:

- `parser.rep1` attempts to match the `parser` 1 or more times, returning a list of the results from each successful match. If `parser` does not succeed at least once, `parser.rep1` fails. Equivalent to `parser.rep & parser`.
- `parser.rep_with(other)` and `parser.rep1_with(other)` repeat the `parser` 0 or more or 1 or more times respectively, except now the `other` parser is invoked in between invocations of `parser`. The output of `other` is discarded, and these methods return a list of values similar to `rep` and `rep1`.
- `parser * n` attempts to match the `parser` exactly `n` times, returning a list of length `n` containing the result of the `n` successes. Fails otherwise.
- `parser.opt` matches the `parser` 0 or 1 times, returning either `[]` or `[result]` where `result` is the result of `parser`. Equivalent to `parser | Succeed([])`
- `parser.join` takes a parser that returns a list of strings (e.g. tuples, `rep`, `rep1`, etc.) and returns a parser which returns the strings concatenated together. Equivalent to `parser // "".join`.

### Transforming values using `//`

So far, these building blocks all return the raw parse tree: all the things like whitespace, curly-braces, etc. will still be there. Often, you want to take a parser e.g.

```python
from macropy.peg import macros, peg
with peg:
    num = '[0-9]+'.r

print repr(num.parse("123")) # '123'
```

which returns a string of digits, and convert it into a parser which returns an `int` with the value of that string. This can be done with the `//` operator:

```python
from macropy.peg import macros, peg
with peg:
    num = '[0-9]+'.r // int

print repr(num.parse("123")) # 123
```

The `//` operator takes a function which will be used to transform the result of the parser: in this case, it is the function `int`, which transforms the returned string into an integer.

Another example is:

```python
with peg:
    laugh = 'lol'
    laughs1 = 'lol'.rep1
    laughs2 = laughs1 // "".join

print laughs1.parse("lollollol") # ['lol', 'lol', 'lol]
print laughs2.parse("lollollol") # lollollol
```

Where the function `"".join"` is used to join together the list of results from `laughs1` into a single string. As mentioned earlier, `laughs2` can also be written as `laughs2 = laughs1.join`.

### Binding Values using `>>`

Although `//` is sufficient for everyone's needs, it is not always convenient. In the example above, a `value` is defined to be:

```python
value = ... | ('(', expr, ')') // (lambda x: x[1])
```

As you can see, we need to strip off the unwanted parentheses from the parse tree, and we do it with a `lambda` that only selects the middle element, which is the result of the `expr` parser. An alternate way of representing this is:

```python
value = ... | ('(', expr is result, ')') >> result
```

In this case, the `is` keyword is used to bind the result of `expr` to the name `result`. The `>>` ("bind") operator can be used to transform the parser by only operating on the *bound* results within the parser. `>>` also binds the results of *other parsers* to their name. Hence the above is equivalent to:

```python
value = ... | ('(', expr, ')') >> expr
```

The `expr` on the left refers to the parser named `expr` in the `with peg:` block, while the `expr` on the right refers to the *results of the parser named `expr` in case of a successful parse*. The parser on the left has to be outside any `is` expressions for it to be captured as above, and so in this line in the above parser:

```python
expr = (value, (op, value).rep is rest) >> reduce_chain([value] + rest)
```

The result of the first `value` on the left of `>>` is bound to `value` on the right, while the second `value` is not because it is within an `is` expression bound to the name `rest`. If you have multiple parsers of the same name on the left of `>>`, you can always refer to each individual explicitly using the `is` syntax shown above.

Althought this seems like a lot of shuffling variables around and meddling with the local scope and semantics, it goes a long way to keep things neat. For example, a JSON parser may define an array to be:

```python
with peg:
    ...
    # parses an array and extracts the relevant bits into a Python list
     array = ('[', (json_exp, (',', json_exp).rep), space.opt, ']') // (lambda x: [x[1][0]] + [y[1] for y in x[1][1]])
    ...
```

Where the huge `lambda` is necessary to pull out the necessary parts of the parse tree into a Python list. Although it works, it's difficult to write correctly and equally difficult to read. Using the `is` operator, this can be rewritten as:

```python
array = ('[', json_exp is first, (',', json_exp is rest).rep, space.opt, ']') >> [first] + rest
```

Now, it is clear that we are only interested in the result of the two `json_exp` parsers. The `>>` operator allows us to use those, while the rest of the parse tree (`[`s, `,`s, etc.) are conveniently discarded. Of course, one could go a step further and us the `rep_with` method which is intended for exactly this purpose:

```python
array = ('[', json_exp.rep_with(',') >> arr, space.opt, ']') >> arr
```

Which arguably looks the cleanest of all!

### Cut

```python
from macropy.peg import macros, peg, cut
with peg:
    expr1 = ("1", "2", "3") | ("1", "b", "c")
    expr2 = ("1", cut, "2", "3") | ("1", "b", "c")

print expr1.parse("1bc") # ['1', 'b', 'c']
print expr2.parse("1bc")
# ParseError: index: 1, line: 1, col: 2
# expr2
# 1bc
#  ^
# expected: '2'
```

`cut` is a special token used in a sequence of parsers, which commits the parsing to the current sequence. As you can see above, without `cut`, the left alternative fails and the parsing then attempts the right alternative, which succeeds. In contrast, with `expr2`, the parser is committed to the left alternative once it reaches the `cut` (after successfully parsing "1") and thus when the left alternative fails, the right alternative is not tried and the entire `parse` fails.

The purpose of `cut` is two-fold:

#### Increasing performance by removing unnecessary backtracking

Using JSON as an example: if your parser sees a `{`, begins parsing a JSON object, but some time later it fails, it does not need to both backtracking and attempting to parse an Array (`[...`), or a String (`"...`), or a Number. None of those could possibly succeed, so cutting the backtracking and failing fast prevents this unnecessary computation.

#### Better error reporting.

For example, if you try to parse the JSON String;

```javascript
{        : "failed lol"}
```

if your JSON parser looks like:

```python
with peg:
    ...
    json_exp = obj | array | string | num | true | false | null
    obj = '{', pair.rep_with(",") , space, '}'
    ...
```

Without `cut`, the only information you could gain from attempting to parse that is something like:

```
index: 0, line: 1, col: 1
json_exp
{    : 1, "wtf": 12.4123}
^
expected: (obj | array | string | true | false | null | number)
```

On the other hand, using a `cut` inside the `object` parser immediately after parsing the first `{`, we could provide a much more specific error:

```
index: 5, line: 1, col: 6
json_exp / obj
{    : 1, "wtf": 12.4123}
     ^
expected: '}'
```

In the first case, after failing to parse `obj`, the `json_exp` parser goes on to try all the other alternatives. After all to them fail to parse, it only knows that trying to parse `json_exp` starting from character 0 doesn't work; it has no way of knowing that the alternative that was "supposed" to work was `obj`.

In the second case, `cut` is inserted inside the `object` parser, something like:

```python
obj = '{', cut, pair.rep_with(",") , space, '}'
```

Once the first `{` is parsed, the parser is committed to that alternative. Thus, when it fails to parse `string`, it knows it cannot backtrack and can immediately end the parsing. It can now give a much more specific source location (character 10) as well as better information on what it was trying to parse (`json / object / string`)

```

You can see that `json_exp` parses that non-trivial blob of JSON into an identical structure as Python's in-built `json` package. In addition, the source of the parser looks almost identical to the PEG grammar it is parsing, shown above. This parser makes good use of the `//` and `>>` operators to transform the output of its individual components, as well as using `rep_with` method to easily parse the comma-separated JSON objects and arrays. This parser is almost fully compliant with the [test cases](http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/) found on the [json.org](www.json.org) website (it doesn't fail, as it should, for deeply-nested JSON arrays), which isn't bad for 50 lines of code.

As mentioned earlier, MacroPEG parsers also provide exceptions with nice error messages when the `parse` method fails, and the JSON parser is no exception. Even when parsing larger documents, the error reporting rises to the challenge:

```python
json_exp.parse("""
    {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "age": 25,
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
            "city": "New York",
            "state": "NY",
            "postalCode": 10021
        },
        "phoneNumbers": [
            {
                "type": "home",
                "number": "212 555-1234"
            },
            {
                "type": "fax",
                "number": 646 555-4567"
            }
        ]
    }
""")

# ParseError: index: 456, line: 19, col: 31
# json_exp / obj / pair / json_exp / array / json_exp / obj
#                 "number": 646 555-4567"
#                               ^

```

Pretty neat! This full example of a JSON parser demonstrates what MacroPEG provides to a programmer trying to write a parser:

- Excellent error reporting
- Simple AST processing, on the fly
- An extremely clear PEG-like syntax
- Extremely concise parser definitions

Not bad for an implementation that spans [350 lines of code](macropy/peg.py)!

Experimental Macros
===================
Below are a selection of macros which demonstrate the cooler aspects of MacroPy, but are not currently stable or tested enough that we would be comfortable using them in production code.

Pattern Matching
----------------
```python
from macropy.case_classes import macros, case
from macropy.experimental.pattern import macros, switch

@case
class Nil():
    pass

@case
class Cons(x, xs):
    pass

def reduce(op, my_list):
    with switch(my_list):
        if Cons(x, Nil()):
            return x
        elif Cons(x, xs):
            return op(x, reduce(op, xs))

print reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(4, Nil()))))
# 7
print reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, Cons(1, Cons(3, Cons(5, Nil()))))
# 15
print reduce(Nil(), lambda a, b: a * b)
# None
```

Pattern matching allows you to quickly check a variable against a series of possibilities, sort of like a [switch statement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement) on steroids. Unlike a switch statement in other languages (Java, C++), the `switch` macro allows you to match against the *inside* of a pattern: in this case, not just that `my_list` is a `Cons` object, but also that the `xs` member of `my_list` is a `Nil` object. This can be nested arbitrarily deep, and allows you to easily check if a data-structure has a particular "shape" that you are expecting. Out of convenience, the value of the leaf nodes in the pattern are bound to local variables, so you can immediately use `x` and `xs` inside the body of the if-statement without having to extract it (again) from `my_list`.

The `reduce` function above (an simple, cons-list specific implementation of [reduce](http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#reduce)) takes a Cons list (defined using [case classes](#case-classes)) and quickly checks if it either a `Cons` with a `Nil` right hand side, or a `Cons` with something else. This is converted (roughly) into:

```python
def reduce(my_list, op):
    if isinstance(my_list, Cons) and isinstance(my_list.xs, Nil):
        x = my_list.x
        return x
    elif isinstance(my_list, Cons):
        x = my_list.x
        xs = my_list.xs
        return op(x, reduce(xs, op))
```

Which is significantly messier to write, with all the `isinstance` checks cluttering up the code and having to manually extract the values you need from `my_list` after the `isinstance` checks have passed.

Another common use case for pattern matching is working with tree structures, like ASTs. This macro is a stylized version of the MacroPy code to identify `with ...:` macros:

```python
def expand_macros(node):
    with switch(node):
        if With(Name(name)):
            return handle(name)
        else:
            return node
```

Compare it to the same code written manually using if-elses:

```python
def expand_macros(node):
    if isinstance(node, With) \
            and isinstance(node.context_expr, Name) \
            and node.context_expr.id in macros.block_registry:
        name = node.context_expr.id

            return handle(name)
    else:
        return node
```

As you can see, matching against `With(Name(name))` is a quick and easy way of checking that the value in `node` matches a particular shape, and is much less cumbersome than a series of conditionals.

It is also possible to use pattern matching outside of a `switch`, by using the `patterns` macro. Within `patterns`, any left shift (`<<`) statement attempts to match the value on the right to the pattern on the left, allowing nested matches and binding variables as described earlier.

```python
from macropy.experimental.pattern import macros, patterns
from macropy.case_classes import macros, case

@case
class Rect(p1, p2): pass

@case
class Line(p1, p2): pass

@case
class Point(x, y): pass

def area(rect):
    with patterns:
        Rect(Point(x1, y1), Point(x2, y2)) << rect
        return (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)

print area(Rect(Point(1, 1), Point(3, 3))) # 4
```

If the match fails, a `PatternMatchException` will be thrown.

```python
print area(Line(Point(1, 1), Point(3, 3)))
# macropy.macros.pattern.PatternMatchException: Matchee should be of type <class 'scratch.Rect'>
```

### Class Matching Details

When you pattern match `Foo(x, y)` against a value `Foo(3, 4)`, what happens behind the
scenes is that the constructor of `Foo` is inspected.  We may find that it takes
two parameters `a` and `b`.  We assume that the constructor then contains lines
like:
```python
self.a = a
self.b = b
```
We don't have access to the source of Foo, so this is the best we can do.
Then `Foo(x, y) << Foo(3, 4)` is transformed roughly into

```python
tmp = Foo(3,4)
tmp_matcher = ClassMatcher(Foo, [NameMatcher('x'), NameMatcher('y')])
tmp_matcher.match(tmp)
x = tmp_matcher.getVar('x')
y = tmp_matcher.getVar('y')
```

In some cases, constructors will not be so standard.  In this case, we can use
keyword arguments to pattern match against named fields.  For example, an
equivalent to the above which doesn't rely on the specific implementation of th constructor is `Foo(a=x, b=y)
<< Foo(3, 4)`.  Here the semantics are that the field `a` is extracted from
`Foo(3,4)` to be matched against the simple pattern `x`.  We could also replace
`x` with a more complex pattern, as in `Foo(a=Bar(z), b=y) << Foo(Bar(2), 4)`.


### Custom Patterns
It is also possible to completely override the way in which a pattern is matched
by defining an `__unapply__` class method of the class which you are pattern
matching.  The 'class' need not actually be the type of the matched object, as
in the following example borrowed from Scala.  The `__unapply__` method takes as
arguments the value being matched, as well as a list of keywords.

The method should then return a tuple of a list of positional matches, and a
dictionary of the keyword matches.

```python
class Twice(object):
    @classmethod
    def __unapply__(clazz, x, kw_keys):
        if not isinstance(x, int) or x % 2 != 0:
            raise PatternMatchException()
        else:
            return ([x/2], {})

with patterns:
    Twice(n) << 8
    print n     # 4
```

Tail-call Optimization
----------------------
```python
from macropy.experimental.tco import macros, tco

@tco
def fact(n, acc=0):
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    else:
        return fact(n-1, n * acc)

print fact(10000)  # doesn't stack overflow
# 28462596809170545189064132121198688901...
```

[Tail-call Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) is a technique which will optimize away the stack usage of functions calls which are in a tail position. Intuitively, if a function **A** calls another function **B**, but does not do any computation after **B** returns (i.e. **A** returns immediately when **B** returns), we don't need to keep around the [stack frame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) for **A**, which is normally used to store where to resume the computation after **B** returns. By optimizing this, we can prevent really deep tail-recursive functions (like the factorial example above) from [overflowing the stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow).

The `@tco` decorator macro doesn't just work with tail-recursive functions, but
also with any generic tail-calls (of either a function or a method) via [trampolining](#trampolining), such this mutually recursive example:

```python
from macropy.experimental.tco import macros, tco

class Example(object):

    @tco
    def odd(n):
    if n < 0:
        return odd(-n)
    elif n == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return even(n - 1)

    @tco
    def even(n):
        if n == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return odd(n-1)

print Example().even(100000)  # No stack overflow
# True
```

Note that both `odd` and `even` were both decorated with `@tco`.  All functions
which would ordinarily use too many stack frames must be decorated.

### Trampolining
How is tail recursion implemented?  The idea is that if a function `f` would
return the result of a recursive call to some function `g`, it could instead
return `g`, along with whatever arguments it would have passed to `g`.  Then
instead of running `f` directly, we run `trampoline(f)`, which will call `f`,
call the result of `f`, call the result of that `f`, etc. until finally some
call returns an actual value.

A transformed (and simplified) version of the tail-call optimized factorial
would look like this

```python
def trampoline_decorator(func):
    def trampolined(*args):
        if not in_trampoline():
            return trampoline(func, args)
        return func(*args)
    return trampolined

def trampoline(func, args):
  _enter_trampoline()
  while True:
        result = func(*args)
        with patterns:
            if ('macropy-tco-call', func, args) << result:
                pass
            else:
                if ignoring:
                    _exit_trampoline()
                    return None
                else:
                    _exit_trampoline()
                    return result

@trampoline_decorator
def fact(n, acc):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return ('macropy-tco-call', fact, [n-1, n * acc])
```


PINQ to SQLAlchemy
------------------
```python
from macropy.experimental.pinq import macros, sql, query, generate_schema
from sqlalchemy import *

# prepare database
engine = create_engine("sqlite://")
for line in open("macropy/experimental/test/world.sql").read().split(";"):
    engine.execute(line.strip())

db = generate_schema(engine)

# Countries in Europe with a GNP per Capita greater than the UK
results = query[(
    x.name for x in db.country
    if x.gnp / x.population > (
        y.gnp / y.population for y in db.country
        if y.name == 'United Kingdom'
    ).as_scalar()
    if (x.continent == 'Europe')
)]
for line in results: print line
# (u'Austria',)
# (u'Belgium',)
# (u'Switzerland',)
# (u'Germany',)
# (u'Denmark',)
# (u'Finland',)
# (u'France',)
# (u'Iceland',)
# (u'Liechtenstein',)
# (u'Luxembourg',)
# (u'Netherlands',)
# (u'Norway',)
# (u'Sweden',)
```

PINQ (Python INtegrated Query) to SQLAlchemy is inspired by [C#'s LINQ to SQL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386976.aspx). In short, code used to manipulate lists is lifted into an AST which is then cross-compiled into a snippet of [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). In this case, it is the `query` macro which does this lifting and cross-compilation. Instead of performing the manipulation locally on some data structure, the compiled query is sent to a remote database to be performed there.

This allows you to write queries to a database in the same way you would write queries on in-memory lists, which is really very nice. The translation is a relatively thin layer of over the [SQLAlchemy Query Language](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/ru/latest/core/tutorial.html), which does the heavy lifting of converting the query into a raw SQL string:. If we start with a simple query:

```python
# Countries with a land area greater than 10 million square kilometers
print query[((x.name, x.surface_area) for x in db.country if x.surface_area > 10000000)\
# [(u'Antarctica', Decimal('13120000.0000000000')), (u'Russian Federation', Decimal('17075400.0000000000'))]
```

This is to the equivalent SQLAlchemy query:

```python
print engine.execute(select([country.c.name, country.c.surface_area]).where(country.c.surface_area > 10000000)).fetchall()
```

To verify that PINQ is actually cross-compiling the python to SQL, and not simply requesting everything and performing the manipulation locally, we can use the `sql` macro to perform the lifting of the query without executing it:

```python
query_string = sql[((x.name, x.surface_area) for x in db.country if x.surface_area > 10000000)]
print type(query_string)
# <class 'sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Select'>
print query_string
# SELECT country_1.name, country_1.surface_area
# FROM country AS country_1
# WHERE country_1.surface_area > ?
```

As we can see, PINQ converts the python list-comprehension into a SQLAlchemy `Select`, which when stringified becomes a valid SQL string. The `?`s are there because SQLAlchemy uses [parametrized queries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement), and doesn't interpolate values into the query itself.

Consider a less trivial example: we want to find all countries in europe who have a [GNP per Capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_product) greater than the United Kingdom. This is the SQLAlchemy code to do so:

```python
query = select([db.country.c.name]).where(
    db.country.c.gnp / db.country.c.population > select(
        [(db.country.c.gnp / db.country.c.population)]
    ).where(
            db.country.c.name == 'United Kingdom'
    ).as_scalar()
).where(
    db.country.c.continent == 'Europe'
)
```

The SQLAlchemy query looks pretty odd, for somebody who knows python but isn't familiar with the library. This is because SQLAlchemy cannot "lift" Python code into an AST to manipulate, and instead have to construct the AST manually using python objects. Although it works pretty well, the syntax and semantics of the queries is completely different from python.

Already we are bumping into edge cases: the `db.country` in the nested query is referred to the same way as the `db.country` in the outer query, although they are clearly different! One may wonder, what if, in the inner query, we wish to refer to the outer query's values? Naturally, there will be solutions to all of these requirements. In the end, SQLAlchemy ends up effectively creating its own mini programming language, with its own concept of scoping, name binding, etc., basically duplicating what Python already has but with messier syntax and subtly different semantics.

In the equivalent PINQ code, the scoping of which `db.country` you are referring to is much more explicit, and in general the semantics are identical to a typical python comprehension:

```python
query = sql[(
    x.name for x in db.country
    if x.gnp / x.population > (
        y.gnp / y.population for y in db.country
        if y.name == 'United Kingdom'
    ).as_scalar()
    if (x.continent == 'Europe')
)]
```

As we can see, rather than mysteriously referring to the `db.country` all over the place, we clearly bind it in two places: once to the variable `x` in the outer query, once to the variable `y` in the inner query. Overall, we make use of Python's syntax and semantics (scoping, names, etc.) rather than having to re-invent our own, which is a big win for anybody who already understands Python.

Executing either of these will give us the same answer:

```python
print query
# SELECT country_1.name
# FROM country AS country_1
# WHERE country_1.gnp / country_1.population > (SELECT country_2.gnp / country_2.population AS anon_1
# FROM country AS country_2
# WHERE country_2.name = ?) AND country_1.continent = ?

results = engine.execute(query).fetchall()

for line in results: print line
# (u'Austria',)
# (u'Belgium',)
# (u'Switzerland',)
# (u'Germany',)
# (u'Denmark',)
# (u'Finland',)
# (u'France',)
# (u'Iceland',)
# (u'Liechtenstein',)
# (u'Luxembourg',)
# (u'Netherlands',)
# (u'Norway',)
# (u'Sweden',)
```

Although PINQ does not support the vast capabilities of the SQL language, it supports a useful subset, like `JOIN`s:

```python
# The number of cities in all of Asia
query = sql[(
    func.count(t.name)
    for c in db.country
    for t in db.city
    if t.country_code == c.code
    if c.continent == 'Asia'
)]
print query
# SELECT count(city_1.name) AS count_1
# FROM city AS city_1, country AS country_1
# WHERE city_1.country_code = country_1.code AND country_1.continent = ?

result = engine.execute(query).fetchall()

print result
[(1766,)]
```

As well as `ORDER BY`, with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`s:

```python
# The top 10 largest countries in the world by population
query = sql[
    (c.name for c in db.country)
    .order_by(c.population.desc())
    .limit(10)
]

print query
# SELECT country_1.name
# FROM country AS country_1
# ORDER BY country_1.population DESC
# LIMIT ? OFFSET ?

res = engine.execute(query).fetchall()
for line in res:
    print line
# (u'China',)
# (u'India',)
# (u'United States',)
# (u'Indonesia',)
# (u'Brazil',)
# (u'Pakistan',)
# (u'Russian Federation',)
# (u'Bangladesh',)
# (u'Japan',)
# (u'Nigeria',)
```

In general, apart from the translation of generator expressions (and their guards) into `SELECT` an `WHERE` clauses, the rest of the functionality of SQL (like the `.order_by()`, `.limit()`, etc. functions shown above) is accessed as in the [SQLAlchemy Expression Language](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/ru/latest/core/tutorial.html#ordering-grouping-limiting-offset-ing). See the [unit tests](https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy/blob/master/macropy/experimental/test/pinq.py) for a fuller set of examples of what PINQ can do, or browse the SQLAlchemy docs mentioned earlier.

PINQ demonstrates how easy it is to use macros to lift python snippets into an AST and cross-compile it into another language, and how nice the syntax and semantics can be for these embedded DSLs. PINQ's entire implementation comprises about [100 lines of code](https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy/blob/master/macropy/experimental/pinq.py), which really isn't much considering how much it does for you!

Pyxl Snippets
-------------

```python
from macropy.experimental.pyxl_strings import macros, p

image_name = "bolton.png"
image = p['<img src="/static/images/{image_name}" />']

text = "Michael Bolton"
block = p['<div>{image}{text}</div>']

element_list = [image, text]
block2 = p['<div>{element_list}</div>']

assert block2.to_string() == '<div><img src="/static/images/bolton.png" />Michael Bolton</div>'
```

[Pyxl](https://github.com/dropbox/pyxl) is a way of integrating XML markup into your Python code. By default, pyxl hooks into the python UTF-8 decoder in order to transform the source files at load-time. In this, it is similar to how MacroPy transforms source files at import time.

A major difference is that Pyxl by default leaves the HTML fragments directly in the source code:

```python
image_name = "bolton.png"
image = <img src="/static/images/{image_name}" />

text = "Michael Bolton"
block = <div>{image}{text}</div>

element_list = [image, text]
block2 = <div>{element_list}</div>
```

While the MacroPy version requires each snippet to be wrapped in a `p["..."]` wrapper. This [three-line-of-code macro](https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy/blob/master/macropy/experimental/pyxl_strings.py) simply uses pyxl as a macro (operating on string literals), rather than hooking into the UTF-8 decoder. In general, this demonstrates how easy it is to integrate an "external" DSL into your python program: MacroPy handles all the intricacies of hooking into the interpreter and intercepting the import workflow. The programmer simply needs to provide the source-to-source transformation, which in this case was already provided.


JS Snippets
------------
```python
from macropy.experimental.javascript import macros, pyjs

code, javascript = pyjs[lambda x: x > 5 and x % 2 == 0]

print code
# <function <lambda> at 0x0000000003515C18>

print javascript
# $def(function $_lambda(x) {return $b.bool($b.do_ops(x, '>', 5)) && $b.bool($b.do_ops($b.mod(x, 2), '==', 0));})

for i in range(10):
    print i, code(i), self.exec_js_func(javascript, i)

# 0 False False
# 1 False False
# 2 False False
# 3 False False
# 4 False False
# 5 False False
# 6 True True
# 7 False False
# 8 True True
# 9 False False
```

JS Snippets is a macro that allows you to mark out sections of code that will be cross-compiled into Javascript at module-import time. This cross-compilation is done using [PJs](https://github.com/jabapyth/PJs). The generated Javascript is incredibly ugly, thanks in part to the fact that in order to preserve semantics in the presence of features that Python has but JS lacks (such as [operator overloading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading)), basically every operation in the Javascript program has to be virtualized into a method call. The translation also breaks down around the fringes of the Python language.

Nonetheless, as the above example demonstrates, the translation is entirely acceptable for simple logic. Furthermore, with macros, marking out snippets of Python code to be translated is as simple as prepending either:

- `js`, if you only want to translate the enclosed python expression into Javascript
- `pyjs`, if you want both the original expression as well as the translated Javascript (as in the example above). This is given to you as a tuple.

`pyjs` is particularly interesting, because it brings us closer to the holy grail of HTML form validation: having validation run on both client and server, but still only be expressed once in the code base. With `pyjs`, it is trivial to fork an expression (such as the conditional function shown above) into both Python and Javascript representations. Rather than using a [menagerie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=HTML%2FForms%2FData_form_validation) of [ad-hoc](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation) [mini-DSLs](https://code.google.com/p/validation-js/wiki/MainDocumentation), this lets you write your validation logic in plain Python.

As mentioned earlier, JS Snippets isn't very robust, and the translation is full of bugs:

```python
# these work
assert self.exec_js(js[10]) == 10
assert self.exec_js(js["i am a cow"]) == "i am a cow"

# these literals are buggy, and it seems to be PJs' fault
# ??? all the results seem to turn into strings ???
assert self.exec_js(js(3.14)) == 3.14 # Fails
assert self.exec_js(js[[1, 2, 'lol']]) == [1, 2, 'lol'] # Fails
assert self.exec_js(js[{"moo": 2, "cow": 1}]) == {"moo": 2, "cow": 1} # Fails

# set literals aren't supported so this throws an exception at macro-expansion time
# self.exec_js(js[{1, 2, 'lol'}])
```

Even as such basic things fail, other, more complex operations work flawlessly:

```python
script = js[sum([x for x in range(10) if x > 5])]
print script
# "$b.sum($b.listcomp([$b.range(10)], function (x) {return x;}, [function (x) { return $b.do_ops(x, '>', 5); }]))"
print self.exec_js(script)
# 30
```

Here's another, less trivial use case: cross compiling a function that searches for the [prime numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number):

```python
code, javascript = pyjs[lambda n: [
    x for x in range(n)
    if 0 == len([
        y for y in range(2, x-2)
        if x % y == 0
    ])
]]
print code(20)
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
print self.exec_js_func(javascript, 20)
# [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```

These examples are all taken from the [unit tests](macropy/experimental/test/js_snippets.py).

Like [PINQ to SQLAlchemy](#pinq-to-sqlalchemy), JS Snippets demonstrates the feasibility, the convenience of being able to mark out sections of code using macros, to be cross-compiled into another language and run remotely. Unlike PINQ, which is built on top of the stable, battle-tested and widely used [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) library, JS Snippets is built on top of an relatively unknown and untested Python to Javascript cross-compiler, making it far from production ready.

Nonetheless, JS Snippets demonstrate the promise of being able to cross-compile bits of your program and being able to run parts of it remotely. The code which performs the integration of PJs and MacroPy is a scant [25 lines long](macropy/experimental/js_snippets.py). If a better, more robust Python to Javascript cross-compiler appears some day, we could easily make use of it to provide a stable, seamless developer experience of sharing code between (web) client and server.


Tutorials
=========
This section contains step-by-step guides to get started writing macros using MacroPy:

- [Writing your First Macro](#writing-your-first-macro)
- [Making your Macros Hygienic](#making-your-macros-hygienic)
- [Exporting your Expanded Code](#exporting-your-expanded-code)

These tutorials proceed through a serious of examples, many of which are available in the [docs/examples](docs/examples) folder.

Writing Your First Macro
------------------------
Now, we will go through what it takes to write a simple macro, with some [self-contained examples](docs/examples). To begin, we need three files

```python
# run.py
# target.py
# macro_module.py
```

As mentioned earlier, you cannot use macros in the `__main__` module (the file that is run directly via `python ...`) and so we have to have a separate bootstrap file `run.py`, which will then execute `target.py`, which contains macros defined in `macro_module.py`.

```python
# run.py
import macropy.activate
import target

# target.py
# macro_module.py
```

Now, let us define a simple macro, in `macro_module.py`

```python
# run.py
import macropy.activate
import target

# target.py
from macro_module import macros, expand

print expand[1 + 2]

# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    return tree
```

Running this via `python run.py` will print out `3`; so far `expand` is a simple no-op macro which does not do anything to the tree it is passed. This macro is provided in [docs/examples/nop](docs/examples/nop) if you want to try it out yourself; you can run it from the project root via `python docs/examples/nop/run.py`.

The `**kw` serves to absorb all the arguments that you did not declare. The macro can take additional arguments (not shown here) which are documented [below](#arguments). Alternately, you can just take a look at what the `**kw` dictionary contains.

The line

```python
from macro_module import macros, expand
```

is necessary to declare what macros you want to use (`expand`), and which module you want to load them from `macro_module`. Aliases also work:

```python
from macro_module import macros, expand as my_alias

print my_alias[1 + 2]
```

As you would expect. Import-alls like `from macro_module import *` do **not** work.

At this point, you can print out the tree you are receiving in various forms just to see what you're getting:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    print tree
    print real_repr(tree)
    print unparse(tree)
    return tree
```

When you run `run.py`, This will print:

```python
<_ast.BinOp object at 0x000000000206BBA8>
BinOp(Num(1), Add(), Num(2))
(1 + 2)
3
```

As you can see, the AST objects don't have a nice `__repr__`, but if you use the MacroPy function `real_repr`, you can see that it's made up of the  `BinOp` `Add`, which adds the two numbers `Num(1)` and `Num(2)`. Unparsing it into source code via `unparse()` gives you `(1 + 2)`, which is what you would expect. In general, unparsing may not give you exactly the original source, but it should be semantically equivalent when executed. Take a look at the [data model](#data-model) to see what other useful conversions are available.

One (trivial) example of modifying the tree is to simply replace it with a new tree, for example:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    return Num(100)
```
When you run `run.py`, this will print out `100`, as the original expression `(1 + 2)` has now been replaced by the literal `100`. Another possible operation would be to replace the expression with the square of itself:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    newtree = BinOp(tree, Mult(), tree)
    return newtree
```

This will replace the expression `(1 + 2)` with `((1 + 2) * (1 + 2))`; you can similarly print out newtree via `unparse` or `real_repr` to see what's it looks like.

### Using Quasiquotes

Building up the new tree manually, as shown above, works reasonably well. However, it can quickly get unwieldy, particularly for more complex expressions. For example, let's say we wanted to make `expand` wrap the expression `(1 + 2)` in a lambda, like `lambda x: x * (1 + 2) + 10`. Ignore, for the moment, that this transform is not very useful. Doing so manually is quite a pain:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    return Lambda(arguments([Name("x", Param())], None, None, []), BinOp(BinOp(Name('x', Load()), Mult(), tree), Add(), Num(10)))
```

This works, and when you run `run.py` it prints out:

```python
<function <lambda> at 0x00000000020A3588>
```

Because now `target.py` is printing out a lambda function. If we modify `target.py` to call the expanded `lambda` with an argument:

```python
# target.py
from macro_module import macros, expand

func = expand[1 + 2]
print func(5)
```

It prints `25`, as you would expect.

[Quasiquotes](#quasiquotes) are a special structure that lets you quote sections of code as ASTs, letting us substitute in sections dynamically. Quasiquotes let us turn the above code into:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q, ast

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    return q[lambda x: x * ast[tree] + 10]
```

the `q[...]` syntax means that the section following it is quoted as an AST, while the unquote `ast[...]` syntax means to place the *value* of `tree` into that part of the quoted AST, rather than simply the node `Name("tree")`. Running `run.py`, this also prints `25`. See [docs/examples/quasiquote](docs/examples/quasiquote) for the self-contained code for this example.

Another unquote `u` allow us to dynamically include the value `10` in the AST at run time:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q, ast, u

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    addition = 10
    return q[lambda x: x * ast[tree] + u[addition]]
```

This will insert the a literal representing the value of `addition` into the position of the `u[addition]`, in this case `10`. This *also* prints 25. For a more detailed description of how quoting and unquoting works, and what more you can do with it, check out the documentation for [Quaasiquotes](#quasiquotes).

Apart from using the `u` and `ast` unquotes to put things into the AST, good old fashioned assignment works too:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def expand(tree, **kw):
    newtree = q[lambda x: x * None + 10]
    newtree.body.left.right = tree          # replace the None in the AST with the given tree
    return newtree
```

If you run this, it will also print `25`.

### Walking the AST

Quasiquotes make it much easier for you to manipulate sections of code, allowing you to quickly put together snippets that look however you want. However, they do not provide any support for a very common use case: that of recursively traversing the AST and replacing sections of it at a time.

Now that you know how to make basic macros, I will walk you through the implementation of a less trivial (and extremely useful!) macro: [quicklambda](#quick-lambdas).

If we look at what [quicklambda](#quick-lambdas) does, we see want to take code which looks like this:

```python
f[_ + (1 * _)]
```

and turn it into:

```python
(arg0 + (1 * arg1))
```

and wrap it in a lambda to give:

```python
lambda arg0, arg1: (arg0 + (1 * arg1))
```

Let's accomplish the first transform first: we need to replace all the `_`s with variables `arg0`, `arg1`, etc.. To do this, we need to recurse over the AST in order to search for the uses of `_`. A simple attempt may be:

```python
# macro_module.py

from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def f(tree, **kw):
    names = ('arg' + str(i) for i in xrange(100))

    def rec(tree):
        if type(tree) is Name and tree.id == '_':
            tree.id = names.next()
        if type(tree) is BinOp:
            rec(tree.left)
            rec(tree.right)
        if type(tree) is List:
            map(rec, tree.elts)
        if type(tree) is UnaryOp:
            rec(tree.operand)
        if type(tree) is BoolOp:
            map(rec, tree.values)
        ...

    newtree = rec(tree)
    return newtree
````

Note that we use `f` instead of `expand`. Also note that writing out the recursion manually is pretty tricky, there are a ton of cases to consider, and it's easy to get wrong. It turns out that this behavior, of walking over the AST and doing something to it, is an extremely common operation, common enough that MacroPy provides the `Walker` class to do this for you:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def f(tree, **kw):
    names = ('arg' + str(i) for i in xrange(100))

    @Walker
    def underscore_search(tree, **kw):
        if type(tree) is Name and tree.id == '_':
            tree.id = names.next()

    newtree = underscore_search.recurse(tree)
    print unparse(newtree) # (arg0 + (1 * arg1))
    return newtree
```

This snippet of code is equivalent to the one earlier, except that with a [Walker](#walkers), you only need to specify the AST nodes you are interested in (in this case `Name`s) and the Walker will do the recursion automatically. As you can see, when we print out the unparsed newtree, we can see that the transformed code looks like what we expect. You could also use the [show_expanded](#show_expanded) macro in `target.py` to see what it looks like:

```python
# target.py
from macro_module import macros, f
from macropy.tracing import macros, show_expanded

with show_expanded:
    my_func = f[_ + (1 * _)]
# my_func = (arg0 + (1 * arg1))
```

Verifying that the code indeed is what we expect.

When run, this code then fails with a

```
NameError: name 'arg0' is not defined
```

At runtime, because the names we put into the tree (`arg0` and `arg1`) haven't actually been defined in `target.py`! We will see how we can fix that.

### More Walking

The function being passed to the Walker can return a variety of things. In this case, let's say we want to collect the names we extracted from the `names` generator, so we can use them to populate the arguments of the `lambda`.

The Walker function request the `collect` argument, and call `collect(item)` to have the `Walker` aggregate them all in one large list which you can extract by using `recurse_collect` instead of `recurse`:

```python
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q, u

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def f(tree, **kw):
    names = ('arg' + str(i) for i in xrange(100))

    @Walker
    def underscore_search(tree, collect, **kw):
        if isinstance(tree, Name) and tree.id == "_":
            name = names.next()
            tree.id = name
            collect(name)
            return tree

    new_tree, used_names = underscore_search.recurse_collect(tree)
    print used_names # ['arg0', 'arg1']
    return new_tree
```

Now we have available both the `new_tree` as well as a list of `used_names`. When we print out `used_names`, we see it is the names that got substituted in place of the underscores within the AST. If you're wondering what other useful things are hiding in the `**kw`, check out the section on [Walkers](#walkers).

This still fails at runtime, but now all we need now is to wrap everything in a `lambda`, set the arguments properly:

```python
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q, u

_ = None  # makes IDE happy

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def f(tree, **kw):
    names = ('arg' + str(i) for i in xrange(100))

    @Walker
    def underscore_search(tree, **kw):
        if isinstance(tree, Name) and tree.id == "_":
            name = names.next()
            tree.id = name
            return tree, collect(name)

    tree, used_names = underscore_search.recurse_collect(tree)

    new_tree = q[lambda: ast[tree]]
    new_tree.args.args = [Name(id = x) for x in used_names]
    print unparse(new_tree) # (lambda arg0, arg1: (arg0 + (1 * arg1)))
    return new_tree
```

And we're done! The printed `new_tree` looks exactly like what we want. The original code:

```python
# target.py
from macro_module import macros, f

print f[_ + (1 * _)]
```

spits out

```
<function <lambda> at 0x000000000203D198>
```

Showing we have successfully replaced all the underscores with variables and wrapped the expression in a lambda! Now when we try to run it:

```python
# target.py
from macro_module import macros, f

my_func = f[_ + (1 * _)]
print my_func(10, 20) # 30
```

It works! We can also use it in some less trivial cases, just to verify that it indeed does what we want:

```python
# target.py
print reduce(f[_ + _], [1, 2, 3])  # 6
print filter(f[_ % 2 != 0], [1, 2, 3])  # [1, 3]
print map(f[_  * 10], [1, 2, 3])  # [10, 20, 30]
```

Mission Accomplished! You can see the completed self-contained example in [docs/examples/full](docs/examples/full). This macro is also defined in our library in [macropy/quick_lambda.py](macropy/quick_lambda.py), along with a suite of [unit tests](macropy/test/quick_lambda.py). It is also used throughout the implementation of the other macros.

Making your Macros Hygienic
---------------------------
In [Writing your First Macro](#writing-your-first-macro), we went through how the use basic tools such as quasiquotes and Walkers in order to perform simple AST transforms. In this section, we will go through the shortcomings of doing the naive transforms, and how to use hygiene to make your macros more robust.

[Hygienic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro) macros are macros which will not accidentally [shadow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing) an identifier, or have the identifiers they introduce shadowed by user code. For example, the [quicklambda](#quick-lambdas) macro takes this:

```python
func = f[_ + 1]
print func(1)
# 2
```

And turns it into a lambda expression. If we did it naively, like we did in the [tutorials](#tutorials), we may expand it into this:

```python
func = lambda arg0: arg0 + 1
print func(1)
# 2
```

However, if we introduce a variable called `arg0` in the enclosing scope:

```python
arg0 = 10
func = f[_ + arg0]
print func(1)
# 2
# should print 11
```

It does not behave as we may expect; we probably want it to produce `11`. this is because the `arg0` identifier introduced by the `f` macro shadows the `arg0` in our enclosing scope. These bugs could be hard to find, since renaming variables could make them appear or disappear. Try executing the code in [docs/examples/hygiene/hygiene_failures](docs/examples/hygiene/hygiene_failures) and to see this for your self.

### gen_sym

There is a way out of this: if you create a new variable, but use an identifier that has not been used before, you don't stand the risk of accidentally shadowing something you didn't intend to. To help with this, MacroPy provides the `gen_sym` function, which you can acquire by adding an extra parameter named `gen_sym` to your macro definition:

```python
@macros.expr
def f(tree, gen_sym, **kw):
    ...
    new_name = gen_sym()
    ... use new_name ...
```

`gen_sym` is a function which produce a new identifier (as a string) every time it is called. This is guaranteed to produce a identifier that does not appear anywhere in the original source code, or have been produced by an earlier call to `gen_sym`. You can thus use these identifiers without worrying about shadowing an identifier someone was using; the full code for this is given in [docs/examples/hygiene/gen_sym](docs/examples/hygiene/gen_sym), so check it out and try executing it to see it working

### Hygienic Quasiquotes
Let's look at another use case: the implementation of the various [tracing](#tracing) macros. These macros generally can't rely solely on AST transforms, but also require runtime support in order to operate. Consider a simple `log` macro:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q, u

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def log(tree, exact_src, **kw):
    new_tree = q[wrap(u[exact_src(tree)], ast[tree])]
    return new_tree

def wrap(txt, x):
    print txt + " -> " + repr(x)
    return x
```

This macro aims to perform a conversion like:

```python
log[1 + 2 + 3] -> wrap("1 + 2 + 3", 1 + 2 + 3)
```

Where the `wrap` function then prints out both the source code and the `repr` of the logged expression. This is but a single example of the myriad of things that expanded macros may need at run time.

Naively performing this transform runs into problems:

```python
from macro_module import macros, log


log[1 + 2 + 3]
# NameError: name 'wrap' is not defined
```

This is because although `wrap` is available in `macro_module.py`, it is not available in `test.py`. Hence the expanded code fails when it tries to reference `wrap`.There are several ways which this can be accomplished:

### Manual Imports

```python
# test.py
from macro_module import macros, log, wrap

log[1 + 2 + 3]
# 1 + 2 + 3 -> 6
```

You can simply import `wrap` from `macro_module.py` into `test.py`, along with the `log` macro itself. This way, the expanded code has a `wrap` function that it can call. Although this works in this example, it is somewhat fragile in the general case, as the programmer could easily accidentally create a variable named `wrap`, not knowing that it was being used by `log` (after all, you can't see it used anywhere in the source code!), causing it to fail:

```python
# test.py
from macro_module import macros, log, wrap

wrap = "chicken salad"

log[1 + 1]
# TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
```

Alternately, the programmer could simply forget to import it, for the same reason:

```python
# test.py
from macro_module import macros, log

log[1 + 1]
# NameError: name 'wrap' is not defined
```

which gives a rather confusing error message: `wrap` is not defined? From the programmer's perspective, `wrap` isn't used at all! These very common pitfalls mean you should probably avoid this approach in favor of the latter two.

### `hq`

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.hquotes import macros, hq, u

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def log(tree, exact_src, **kw):
    new_tree = hq[wrap(u[exact_src(tree)], ast[tree])]
    return new_tree

def wrap(txt, x):
    print txt + " -> " + repr(x)
    return x
```
```python
# test.py
from macro_module import macros, log

wrap = 3 # try to confuse it

log[1 + 2 + 3]
# 1 + 2 + 3 -> 6
# it still works despite trying to confuse it with `wrap`
```

The important changes in this snippet, as compared to the previous, are:

- The removal of `wrap` from the import statement.
- Replacement of `q` with `hq`

`hq` is the hygienic quasiquote macro. Unlike traditional quasiquotes (`q`), `hq` jumps through some hoops in order to ensure that the `wrap` you are using inside the `hq[...]` expression really-truly refers to the `wrap` that is in scope *at the macro definition point*, not at tbe macro expansion point (as would be the case using the normal `q` macro). The end-result is that `wrap` refers to the `wrap` you want in `macro_module.py`, and not whatever `wrap` happened to be defined in `test.py`. See [docs/examples/hygiene/hygienic_quasiquotes](docs/examples/hygiene/hygienic_quasiquotes) to see it working.

In general, `hq` allows you to refer to anything that is in scope where `hq` is being used. Apart from module-level global variables and functions, this includes things like locally scoped variables, which will be properly saved so they can be referred to later even when the macro has completed:

```python
# macro_module.py
@macros.block
def expand(tree, gen_sym, **kw):
    v = 5
    with hq as new_tree:
        return v
    return new_tree
```
```python
# test.py
def run():
    x = 1
    with expand:
        pass

print run() # prints 5
```

In this case, the value of `v` is captured by the `hq`, such that even when `expand` has returned, it can still be used to return `5` to the caller of the `run()` function.

### Breaking Hygiene
By default, all top-level names in the `hq[...]` expression (this excludes things like the contents of `u[]` `name[]` `ast[]` unquotes) are hygienic, and are bound to the variable of that name at the macro definition point. This means that if you want a name to bind to some variable *at the macro expansion point*, you can always manually break hygiene by using the `name[]` or `ast[]` unquotes. The `hq` macro also provides an `unhygienic[...]` unquote just to streamline this common requirement:

```python
@macros.block
def expand(tree, gen_sym, **kw):
    v = 5
    with hq as new_tree:
        # all these do the same thing, and will refer to the variable named
        # 'v' whereever the macro is expanded
        return name["v"]
        return ast[Name(id="v")]
        return unhygienic[v]
    return new_tree
```

Although all these do the same thing, you should prefer to use `unhygienic[...]` as it makes the intention clearer than using `name[...]` or `ast[...]` with hard-coded strings.

### `expose_unhygienic`
Going back to the `log` example:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.hquotes import macros, hq, u, unhygienic

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def log(tree, exact_src, **kw):
    new_tree = hq[wrap(unhygienic[log_func], u[exact_src(tree)], ast[tree])]
    return new_tree


def wrap(printer, txt, x):
    printer(txt + " -> " + repr(x))
    return x

@macros.expose_unhygienic
def log_func(txt):
    print txt
```

`expose_unhygienic` is a hybrid between manual importing and `hq`. Like manual importing, decorating functions with `expose_unhygienic` causes them to be imported under their un-modified name, meaning they can shadow and be shadowed by other identifiers in the macro-expanded code. Like `expose`, it does not require the source file using the macros to put the identifier in the import list. This helps match what users of the macro expect: since the name doesn't ever appear anywhere in the source, it doesn't make sense for the macro to require the name being imported to work.

In this example, the `log` macro uses `expose_unhygienic` on a `log_func` function. The macro-expanded code by default will capture the `log_func` function imported from `macro_module.py`, which prints the log to the console:

```python
# test.py
from macro_module import macros, log

log[1 + 1]
# 1 + 1 -> 2
```

But a user can intentionally shadow `log_func` in order to redirect the logging, for example to a list

```python
# test.py
from macro_module import macros, log

buffer = []
def log_func(txt):
    buffer.append(txt)

log[1 + 2 + 3]
log[1 + 2]
# doesn't print anything

print buffer
# ['1 + 2 + 3 -> 6', '1 + 2 -> 3']
```

See [docs/examples/hygiene/unhygienic](docs/examples/hygiene/unhygienic) to see this example in action. In general, `expose_unhygienic` is useful when you want the macro to use a name that can be intentionally shadowed by the programmer using the macro, allowing the programmer to implicitly modify the behavior of the macro via this shadowing.

----------------------------------------

This section has covered how to use the various tools available (`gen_sym`, `hq`, `expose_unhygienic`) in order to carefully control the scoping and variable binding in the code generated by macros. See the section on [Hygiene](#hygiene) for a more detailed explanation of what's going on behind the scenes.

Exporting your Expanded Code
----------------------------
Although MacroPy is designed to work seamlessly on-line, seamlessly translating your code on the fly as it gets imported, without having to trouble the programmer with a multi-stage expansion/execution process. However, there are use reasons for performing an explicit expansion:

- **Performance**: walking the AST takes time, which may grow unbearable as the amount of code grows large. Pre-compiling (or at least caching) the macro-expanded code would save some frustration
- **Deployment**: you may be deploying your code in a Python environment where MacroPy doesn't function (e.g. Jython), or you may want to package your code as a library without forcing your users to have a dependency on MacroPy
- **Debugging**: although MacroPy provides tools to help figure out what's happening when things go wrong (e.g. `show_expanded`) it may sometimes to easier just to take a compile source dump of the entire source-tree after macro expansion so you can debug it directly, rather than through the expansion process

MacroPy allows you to hook into the macro-expansion process via the `macropy.exporter` variable, which comes with three bundled values which can satisfy these constraints:

- [NullExporter()](#nullexporter): this is the default exporter, which does nothing
- [SaveExporter(target, root)](#saveexportertarget-root): this saves a copy of your code tree (rooted at `root`), with macros expanded, in the `target` directory. This is a convenient way of exporting the entire source tree with macros expanded
- [PycExporter()](#PycExporter): this emulates the normal `.pyc` compilation and caching based on file `mtime`s. This is a convenient transparent-ish cache to avoid needlessly performing macro-expansion repeatedly.

### NullExporter()
This is the default Exporter, and although it does not do anything, it illustrates the general contract of what an Exporter must look like:

```python
class NullExporter(object):
    def find(self, file, pathname, description, module_name, package_path):
        pass

    def export_transformed(self, code, tree, module_name, file_name):
        pass
```

In short, it has two methods: `find` and `export_transformed`.

- `find` is called after a file has been loaded and the use of macros have been detected inside. It can either return `None`, in which case macro-expansion goes ahead, or a `module` object, in which case macro-expansion is simply skipped and the returned `module` object is used instead.
- `export_transformed` is called after macro-expansion has been successfully completed (It is not triggered on failures). Whatever it returns doesn't matter.

The arguments to these methods are relatively self explanatory, but feel free to inject `print` statements into `NullExporter` if you want to see what's what.

### SaveExporter(target, root)

This exporter is activated immediately after the initial `import macropy.activate` statement, via:

```python
import macropy.activate
macropy.exporter = SaveExporter("exported", ".")
```

It creates a copy of your source tree (rooted at `root`) in the `target` directory, and any file which is macro-expanded will have its expanded representation saved in that directory. For example, if you have a project:

```
run.py
my_macro.py
file.py
stuff/
    thing.py
```

Assuming `run.py` is the entry point containing the `import macropy.activate` statement, we need to:

- Modify it, as shown above, to contain the `macropy.exporter = SaveExporter(..., ...)` line
- Run it, via `python run.py` or similar

```
run.py
my_macro.py
file.py
stuff/
    thing.py
saved/
    run.py
    my_macro.py
    file.py
    stuff/
        thing.py
```

Where all macros within the files in the `saved/` subdirectory which were executed in the course of execution have been expanded. You can verify this by removing the `import macropy.activate` and `macropy.exporter = ...` lines from `saved/run.py` (Thereby disabling MacroPy) and executing `saved/run.py` directly. Everything should run as normal, demonstrating that all macros have been expanded the dependencies on MacroPy's import hooks and AST transformations have been removed.

Note that *only macros in files which get expanded in the execution of the program will have their expanded versions saved*. This allows you to control which files you want to perform the macro-expansion-and-save on: for example, most projects have utility scripts which cannot be imported from the root, or example files which are similarly not directly importable.

In most cases, activating the `SaveExporter` and executing your test suite should cause all files necessary to be imported, expanded and saved. If you need more customization, you could easily create a script that performs exactly the imports you need, or [imports all modules in a folder](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1057431/loading-all-modules-in-a-folder-in-python), or any other behavior your want.

### Pre-expanding the MacroPy Test Suite

The following example can be used to expand-and-save MacroPy's own test suite, such that it can be run without macros:

```python
# run_tests.py
import unittest
import macropy.activate
from macropy.core.exporters import SaveExporter
macropy.exporter = SaveExporter("exported", ".")
import macropy.test

unittest.TextTestRunner().run(macropy.test.Tests)
```

MacroPy's test suite clearly makes *extremely extensive* use of macros. Nevertheless, activating `SaveExporter` before running the test suite makes a copy of the entire source-tree with all macros expanded; inspecting any of the previously-macro-using files in the newly-created `exported/` directory demonstrates that the macros have really, truly, been expanded:

```python
# exported/macropy/string_interp.py
from pickle import loads as sym1
import re
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.hquotes import macros, u, ast_list
macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def s(tree, **kw):
    captured = []
    new_string = ''
    chunks = re.split('{(.*?)}', tree.s)
    for i in range(0, len(chunks)):
        if ((i % 2) == 0):
            new_string += chunks[i]
        else:
            new_string += '%s'
            captured += [chunks[i]]
    result = BinOp(left=ast_repr(new_string), op=Mod(), right=Call(func=Captured(tuple, 'tuple'), args=[List(elts=map(parse_expr, captured))], keywords=[], starargs=None, kwargs=None))
    return result
```

We can disable MacroPy's runtime transformations completely by removing the import hook:
```python
# exported/macropy/__init__.py
import sys
import core.import_hooks
import core.exporters
import os
# sys.meta_path.append(core.import_hooks.MacroFinder)
__version__ = "0.2.0"
exporter = core.exporters.NullExporter()
```

And when we run the saved, macro-expanded, macro-less version via `cd exported; python run_tests.py`:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 76 tests in 0.150s

FAILED (failures=4, errors=1)
```

A few minor failures, mainly in the error-message/line-numbers tests, as the pre-expanded code will have different line numbers than the just-in-time-expanded ASTs. Nonetheless, on the whole it works.

------------------------------------------------

The SaveExporter should be of great help to any library-author who wants to use
Macros internally (e.g. [case classes](#case-classes) to simplify class
declarations, or [MacroPeg](#macropeg-parser-combinators) to write a parser)
but does not want to saddle users of the library with having to activate import
hooks, or wants to run the code in an environment where such functionality is
not supported (e.g. Jython).

By using the `SaveExporter`, the macro-using code is expanded into plain
Python, and although it may rely on MacroPy as a library (e.g. the `CaseClass`
class in [macropy/experimental/peg.py](macropy/experimental/peg.py)) it won't
need any of MacroPy's import-code-intercepting AST-transforming capabilities at
run-time.

### PycExporter()
The PycExporter makes MacroPy perform the same `*.pc -> *.pyc` caching that the
normal Python import process does. This can be activated via:

```python
import macropy.activate
macropy.exporter = PycExporter()
```

The macro-expansion process takes significantly longer than normal imports, and
this may be helpful if you have a large number of large files using macros and
you want to save having to re-expand them every execution.

Although `PycExporter` automatically does the recompilation of the
macro-expanded files when they are modified, it notably *does not* do
recompilation of the macro-expanded files when *the macros* are modified. This
means that `PycExporter` is not useful when doing development on the macros
themselves, since the output files will not get properly recompiled when the
macros change. For now it is best to simply use the
[NullExporter](#nullexporter) when messing with your macros, and only using the
[PycExporter](#pycexporter) when your macros are stable and you are working on
the target code.

Reference
=========
This section contains reference documentation on various facets of MacroPy:

Data Model
----------
As mentioned earlier, MacroPy uses PEP 302 for much of its functionality. It
looks out in particular for the syntactic forms (`import macros, ...`,
`my_macro[...]`, `with my_macro:`, `@my_macro`) to decide which
parts of the AST need to be expanded by which macros. MacroPy uses the inbuilt
Python infrastructure for [parsing the
source](http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html#ast.parse) and [representing
it as an AST](http://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html#abstract-grammar). You
should familiarize yourself with the classes which make up the Python AST,
since you will be interacting with them a great deal while writing macros.

Once you have an AST, there are a few possible forms that code can take:

- A **String**
- An **AST**
- A computed **Value**

This map maps out how to convert from form to form:

![Transforms](docs/media/Transforms.png)

Except for `eval`, these are all functions defined in the
[macropy/core/__init__.py](macropy/core/__init__.py). For instance, in order to
convert from a AST back into source code (for example if you want to print out
the code which is being run), you would use the `unparse()` method. These
transformations will be used throughout this documentation, to convert from one
form to another or to print out the AST for inspection.

### `parse_stmt(src)` & `parse_expr(src)`
Thin wrappers around [ast.parse](...), these functions simplify the common case
where you want to convert a code snippet into a list of `stmt`s or a single
`expr`.

### `unparse(tree)`
This function performs the conversion of the Python AST back into semantically
equivalent source code; using `parse_stmt` or `parse_expr` on the generated
should return the original AST.

Although the generated code preserves semantic equivalence, this function does
not preserve `lineno`s, `col_offset`s or syntactic equivalence in general.
Hence your indentation may change, there may be extra parentheses added, etc..
The code is not obfuscated (It's typically straightforward to see what its
doing, even with the syntactic changes) but you will not get back the exact
original source.

### `exact_src(tree)`
This function differs from `unparse` in that instead of generating source code
from the AST, it searches the original source of the file being macro-expanded
for the exact original source code which generated this AST, using the `lineno`
  and `col_offset` as a guide. This means that it will generally fail on
  synthetic ASTs (which will not have a matching snippet in the source code)
  and raise an `ExactSrcException`. Unlike the rest of these functions, which
  are global, `exact_src` is provided to your macro as an [argument](#argument)
  as the `exact_src` for the same AST could vary between macro expansions.

### `real_repr`
A combination of `repr` and `ast.dump`, this function generally does the right thing in converting arbitrary values into Python source code which can be evaluated to re-create those values.

### `ast_repr`
Similar to `real_repr`, `ast_repr` directly generates a Python AST instead of generating strings. This AST can be unparsed and `eval`ed, or just directly `eval`ed, to re-create the original value

### `eval`
Unlike the rest of the functions listed here, `eval` is the standard Python function provided as a builtin. It evaluates either source code or an AST to produce a value.

Arguments
---------
Any macro which is called receives a number of things from MacroPy in order to perform its duties (the syntax transformation). A simple macro may just require

```python
@macros.expr
def my_simple_macro(tree, **kw):
    ...
```

While a more complex macro may require more of the functionality provided by MacroPy:

```python
@macros.expr
def my_complex_macro(tree, args, gen_sym, target, **kw):
    ...
```

These additional arguments given to the macro as keyword arguments. The macro
can declare the arguments as part of its parameter list in order to use it
directly, otherwise it gets chucked into the `**kw` dict at the end of the
macro's parameter list. This section details what each argument means and why
it is useful.

### `tree`
This is, the AST provided to the macro, which it can transform/replace. It contains the code captured by the macro, which varies depending on the macro used:

- The right hand side of an **expression macro**: `my_macro(A + B)` captures the tree for `(A + B)`.
- The body of a **block macro**:

```python
with my_macro:
    do_stuff()
    return blah
```

will capture the statements in the body of the `with`: in this case a list
containing the AST for `do_stuff()` and `return blah`.

- The entire class or function definition for a **decorator macro**, including
  *any decorators below the macro itself*:

```python
@dec
@my_macro
@inner_dec
class Cls():
    blah
```

Captures the AST for:

```python
@inner_dec
class Cls():
    blah
```

### `args`

Macros can take addition arguments when invoked, apart from the primary tree
that it receives. For example a macro can be invoked as follows:

```python
my_macro(a)[...]

with my_macro(a):
    ...

@my_macro(a)
def func():
    ...
```

In these cases, `args` contains a list of additional arguments, a length-1 list
containing the AST for `a`. Multiple arguments works as you would expect,
although named arguments, `*args* and `**kwargs` are not supported. This is
used in [pattern matching](#pattern-matching)'s switch macro to indicate what
value to switch on.

### `gen_sym`

As [described below](#hygiene), `gen_sym` provides a mechanism for creating
identifiers that are guaranteed not to clash with any other identifier in the
same source file. `gen_sym` is a 0-argument function, which when called via:

```python
gen_sym()
```

Will produce a new identifier (as a string) which does not exist in the source
code, and has not been provided before. This is used in the (quick lambda
macro)[#quick-lambda) to ensure that the new arguments do not collide.

### `target`

This argument is only provided for **block macros**. It provides a way to
capture the bound name in the `with` statement:

```python
with my_macro as blah:
    ...
```

`target` will contain the AST for `blah`. This is used in the
[quasiquotes](#quasiquotes) macro.

### `exact_src`

This is a function that attempts to retrieve the source code of the target AST,
exactly as written in the source code. This is in contrast to `unparse`, which
produces semantically correct code that may differ in syntax from what was
originally parsed, for example it may have extra parentheses, be missing
comments, and have the whitespace and layout modified, and a variety of other
syntactic changes:

```python
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) -> (((1 + 2) + 3) + 4)
"lol", 'rofl' -> ('lol', 'rofl')
```

In contrast `exact_src(tree)` promises that you get exactly what was written in
the source code, down to the choice of single quotes vs double quotes:

```python
"lol", 'rofl' -> "lol", 'rofl'
```

It does this by analyzing the `lineno` and `col_offset` values on the AST it is
passed, comparing those against the known values within the source file the AST
originates from and making a best-effort attempt to extract the corresponding
snippet of code. This obviously only really works on ASTs that originated
directly from the source code, and will fail on ASTs you synthesized manually.

### `expand_macros`

`expand_macros` is a function that can be called by a macro to expand any
macros in the target AST. For example, the `tracing` module's `show_expanded`
macro uses it to print out what the captured AST looks like after expansion:

```python
@macros.expr
def show_expanded(tree, expand_macros, **kw):
    expanded_tree = expand_macros(tree)
    new_tree = q[wrap_simple(log, u[unparse(expanded_tree)], ast[expanded_tree])]
    return new_tree
```

Note that macro expansion *mutates the tree being expanded*. In the case of the
`show_expanded` macro, it doesn't really matter (since the tree was going to
get expanded anyway). However, if you want to preserve the original AST for any
reason, you should
[deepcopy](http://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy) the
original AST and do your expansion on the copy.

Quasiquotes
-----------

```python
from macropy.core.quotes import macros, q, name, ast

a = 10
b = 2
tree = q[1 + u[a + b]]
print ast.dump(tree)
#BinOp(Num(1), Add(), Num(12))
```

Quasiquotes are the foundation for many macro systems, such as that found in [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP). Quasiquotes save you from having to manually construct code trees from the nodes they are made of. For example, if you want the code tree for

```python
(1 + 2)
```

Without quasiquotes, you would have to build it up by hand:

```python
tree = BinOp(Num(1), Add(), Num(2))
```

But with quasiquotes, you can simply write the code `(1 + 2)`, quoting it with `q` to lift it from an expression (to be evaluated) to a tree (to be returned):

```python
tree = q[1 + 2]
```

Furthermore, quasiquotes allow you to _unquote_ things: if you wish to insert the **value** of an expression into the tree, rather than the **tree** making up the expression, you unquote it using `u`. In the example above:

```python
tree = q[1 + u[a + b]]
print ast.dump(tree)
#BinOp(Num(1), Add(), Num(12))
```

the expression `(a + b)` is unquoted. Hence `a + b` gets evaluated to the value of `12`, which is then inserted into the tree, giving the final tree.

Apart from interpolating values in the AST, you can also interpolate:

### Other ASTs

```python
a = q[1 + 2]
b = q[ast[a] + 3]
print ast.dump(b)
#BinOp(BinOp(Num(1), Add(), Num(2)), Add(), Num(3))
```

This is necessary to join together ASTs directly, without converting the interpolated AST into its `repr`. If we had used the `u` interpolator, it fails with an error

### Names
```python
n = "x"
x = 1
y = q[name[n] + name[n]]
print ast.dump(y)
#BinOp(Name('x'), Add(), Name('x'))
```

This is convenient in order to interpolate a string variable as an identifier, rather than interpolating it as a string literal. In this case, I want the syntax tree for the expression `x + x`, and not `'x' + 'x'`, so I use the `name` macro to unquote it.

Overall, quasiquotes are an incredibly useful tool for assembling or manipulating the ASTs, and are used in the implementation in all of the following examples. See the [String Interpolation](macropy/string_interp.py) or [Quick Lambda](macropy/quick_lambda.py) macros for short, practical examples of their usage.


Walkers
-------

The Walker is a uniform abstraction to use for recursively traversing a Python AST. Defined in [macropy/core/walkers.py](macropy/core/walkers.py), it is used throughout MacroPy, both in the core logic as well as the implementation of most of the macros.

In its most basic form, a Walker is used as follows:
```python
@Walker
def transform(tree, **kw):
    ...
    return new_tree
```

This walker applies the `transform` function to every node in the AST it recurses over, and is called via:

```python
new_tree = transform.recurse(old_tree)
```

The `transform` function can either mutate the given `tree` (e.g. by changing its attributes, swapping out children, etc.) or replace it by returning a new one (like in the example above). Returning `None` leaves the tree as-is without replacing it (although it still could have been mutated).

Apart from receiving and returning a `tree`, the `transform` function can receive a range of other arguments. By default, these all go into the `**kw`, but can be explicitly declared for ease of use:

```python
@Walker
def transform(tree, ctx, set_ctx, **kw):
    ... do stuff with ctx ...
    set_ctx(...)
    return new_tree
```

This section documents what each one does.

### `ctx`

The Walker allows the programmer to provide a *context*:

```python
@Walker
def transform(tree, ctx, **kw):
    ... do stuff with ctx ...
    return new_tree

new_tree = transform.recurse(old_tree)
new_tree = transform.recurse(old_tree, init_ctx)
```

If the `transform` function takes an additional argument, it will be given the `init_ctx` that is passed in as the second argument to the `.recurse()` method (default `None`).

### `set_ctx`
Apart from using the `ctx` passed in to the `recurse` method, `transform` can request for the `set_ctx` function:

```python
@Walker
def transform(tree, ctx, set_ctx, **kw):
    ... do stuff with ctx ...
    set_ctx(new_ctx)
    return new_tree
```
This will cause all children of the current `tree` to receive `new_ctx` as their `ctx` argument.

### `collect`

The Walker provides an easy way for  the programmer to aggregate data as it recurses over the AST. This is done by requesting the `collect` argument:

```python
@Walker
def transform(tree, collect, **kw):
    ...
    collect(value)
    return new_tree

new_tree, collected = transform.recurse_collect(old_tree)
collected = transform.collect(old_tree)
```

Using the `recurse_collect` instead of the `recurse` method to return both the new `tree` as well as the collected data, as a list. This is a simple way of aggregating values as you traverse the AST.

### `stop`

Lastly, the Walker provides a way to end the recursion, via the `stop` functionm:

```python
@Walker
def transform(tree, stop, **kw):
    ...
    if ...:
        return new_tree
    else:
        stop()
```

Calling `stop` prevents the `Walker` from recursing over the children of the current node. This is useful, for example, if you know that the current node's AST subtree does not contain anything of interest to you and wish to save some computation. Another use case would be if you wish to delimit your transformation: if you want any code within a certain construct to be passed over by `transform`, you can simply have `transform` return `stop` when it sees that construct.

### A Flexible Tool
The `transform` function can take any combination of the above arguments. For example, you could have a walker such as:

```python
@Walker
def transform(tree, ctx, set_ctx, collect, stop, **kw):
    ...
    return new_tree

new_tree, collected = transform.recurse_collect(old_tree, initial_ctx)
```

This provides it a large amount of versatility, and lets you use the `Walker` to recursively traverse and transform Python ASTs in interesting ways. If you inspect the source code of the macros in the [macropy](macropy) and [macropy/experimental](macropy/experimental) folders, you will see most of them make extensive use of `Walker`s in order to concisely perform their transformations. If you find yourself needing a recursive traversal, you should think hard about why you cannot use a Walker before writing the recursion yourself.


Hygiene
-------

MacroPy provides a number of tools for writing Hygienic macros:

### `gen_sym`
`gen_sym` is a function MacroPy provides to your macro as an [argument](#arguments) that generates a new, un-used name every time it is called:

```python
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def f(tree, gen_sym, **kw):
    print gen_sym() # sym0
    print gen_sym() # sym1
    print gen_sym() # sym2
    print gen_sym() # sym3
    # skipping sym4 because it's already used in the target file
    print gen_sym() # sym5

```

This works by first scanning the entire macro-using file to see which names are currently in use, and thereafter providing names which do not appear on that list. This should generally work, for a name that is neither defined nor referenced in a file is almost certainly not used. However, due to Python's dynamic nature, this cannot be guaranteed, and there are cases where `gen_sym` will fail:

```python
# module_a.py
from macro_module import macros, my_macro

with my_macro: # a macro which uses gen_sym()
    ...
```
```python
# module_b.py
import module_a
module_a.sym0 = 10
...
do_stuff_with(module_a.sym0)
```

In this case, a separate file `module_b` is using `module_a` as a convenient namespace to store the value 10. `module_a` has no way of knowing this, and `gen_sym` does not see `sym0` used anywhere in that file, and so assumes `sym0` is safe to use. If `my_macro` ends up writing to and reading from `sym0` in module-scope, this could cause `my_macro`'s and `module_b`'s read/writes to conflict, resulting in the weird bugs that `gen_sym` is meant to avoid. Another unfortunate scenario is:

```python
# module_a.py
sym0 = 10
```
```python
# module_b.py
from module_a import *
from macro_module import macros, my_macro

with my_macro: # a macro which uses gen_sym()
    ...
```
```python
# module_c.py
from module_b import sym0
do_stuff_with(sym0)
```

Again, due to the nature of `import *`, `module_c` can rely on `sym0` being present in `module_b` while `module_b` itself is completely unaware.

These edge cases are unavoidable, but luckily this sort of code is frowned upon in general (not just in Python!). Although Python's philosophy of "We're all adults" means that it's always possible to go out of your way and cause `gen_sym` to fail, this is the case for other code too, and in practice this should not be a problem.

### Hygienic Quasiquotes
Hygienic quasiquotes, created using the `hq[...]` macro, are quasiquotes who automatically bind identifiers from the lexical scope of the macro definition, rather than from that of the macro expansion point. Thus, in the following `log` macro:

```python
# macro_module.py
from macropy.core.macros import *
from macropy.core.hquotes import macros, hq, u

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def log(tree, exact_src, **kw):
    new_tree = hq[wrap(u[exact_src(tree)], ast[tree])]
    return new_tree

def wrap(txt, x):
    print txt + " -> " + repr(x)
    return x
```
```python
# test.py
from macro_module import macros, log

wrap = 3 # try to confuse it

log[1 + 2 + 3]
# 1 + 2 + 3 -> 6
# it still works despite trying to confuse it with `wraps`
```

We can be sure that the `wrap` we referred to inside the `hq[...]` macro is guaranteed to be the `wrap` you see in `macro_module.py`, and not some other `wrap` that a user may have created in `test.py`.

This is accomplished by having the `hq[...]` macro expand each identifier, roughly, via:

```python
hq[wrap]
q[name[hygienic_self_ref].macros.registered[u[macros.register(%s)]]]
```

Where `hygienic_self_ref` is a special identifier (found in [macropy/core/macros.py](macropy/core/macros.py) which tells MacroPy to insert an identifier referring back to the module of the currently-executing macro.

Using `wrap` as an example, `hq` uses `macros.register` to save the current value of `wrap`. `macros.register` returns an index, which can be used to retrieve it later. `hq` then, using the identifier which takes the place of `hygienic_self_ref`, returns a code snippet that will look up the correct `macros.registered` at run-time and retrieve the value. This effectively saves every identifier seen by the `hq` macro and provides it to the macro-expanded code.

One thing to note is that `hq` pickles all captured names and saves them in the expanded module, which unpickles them for usage. This is done in order to ensure consistency of behavior with [exported](#exporting-your-expanded-code) code, but it comes with a small number of caveats:

- Unpickleable values (e.g. module objects, nested functions, lambdas) can't be captured in a `hq`
- Values get copied in the pickling/unpickling process. If a macro's `hq`s capture the same mutable object when the macro is used to expand different modules, each module gets its own version of that mutable object.

Although this behavior is slightly unintuitive, in general they should only affect you in the edge cases. In the vast majority of use cases, you will not bump into these issues at all, and when you do, they are easy enough to work around.

### `expose_unhygienic`
Annotating something with `@expose_unhygienic` simply synthesizes an import in the macro-expanded module to pull in the name from the macro's own module. E.g. in the case of the `log` macro, it converts

```python
from macro_module import macros, log
```

into

```python
from macro_module import macros, log, log_func
```

Thus, the imported name (`log_func`) is subject to shadowing and name collisions just like any other import, with the caveat that unlike other imports, `log_func` doesn't appear anywhere in the source code of the macro-expanded module! This adds a certain amount of potential implicitness, and thus confusion to the system. On the other hand, the implicitness is a boon in cases like the `log` macro, where forcing the user to explicitly pass in the `log_func` into every invocation of `log[...]` gets tiring extremely quickly. `@expose_unhygienic` is therefore best use sparingly, and only after thinking carefully about whether the convenience is worth the added confusion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, MacroPy does not enforce hygiene on the macros you write; it is entirely possible to write macros which require manual importing, or whose identifiers collide with identifiers in the macro-expanded file with unpredictable results. At any time, the entire AST of the Python code fragment is directly available to you, and you can stich together raw quasiquotes any way you like.

Nonetheless, by providing `gen_sym` and the `hq` hygienic quasiquote macro, MacroPy makes it trivially easy to have hygiene. `gen_sym` provides a way of creating temporary names which are guaranteed not to collide with names already in use, and hygienic quasiquotes take it a step further and allow you to directly reference anything in scope at the macro definition point without having to worry about things like name collisions or fiddling with imports. These tools should be sufficient to make your macros hygienic, and are used throughout the suite of macros bundled with MacroPy.


Expansion Failures
------------------
```python
>>> import macropy.console
0=[]=====> MacroPy Enabled <=====[]=0
>>> from macropy.case_classes import macros, enum
>>> @enum
... class X:
...     1 + 2
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "macropy\core\failure.py", line 13, in raise_error
    raise ex
MacroExpansionError: Can't have `(1 + 2)` in body of enum
```
Macros can fail for a variety of reasons. Chief among them is that the macro contains a bug, which causes an uncaught exception to occur at run-time, but there are other scenarios, for example the user of the macro violating the contract of that macro. In the above example, the `enum` macro only allows instance definitions and method definitions in the body of the enumeration, and the macro therefore fails with a helpful error message to allow the user to rectify the problem.

The errors thrown by failed macros are just normal exceptions, and can be caught just like any others:

```python
>>> try:
...     @enum
...     class X:
...         1 + 2
... except:
...     print "caught!"
...
caught!
```

Macros that fail "naturally", e.g. because of an uncaught exception, have an added benefit: their error message will contain the stack trace of both the original error (deep within the code of the macro) and the point where the macro was used, to help in the debugging effort:

```python
# macropy/core/test/failure_macro.py
from macropy.core.failure import MacroExpansionError
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.expr
def f(tree, gen_sym, **kw):
    raise Exception("i am a cow")
```
```python
>>> from macropy.core.test.failure_macro import macros, f
>>> def failing_func():
...     return f[10]
...
>>> failing_func()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<console>", line 2, in failing_func
  File "macropy\core\failure.py", line 13, in raise_error
    raise ex
MacroExpansionError: i am a cow
Caused by Macro-Expansion Error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "macropy\core\macros.py", line 117, in expand_if_in_registry
    **dict(kwargs.items() + file_vars.items())
  File "macropy\core\macros.py", line 28, in __call__
    return self.func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "macropy\core\test\failure_macro.py", line 8, in f
    raise Exception("i am a cow")
Exception: i am a cow
```

### Implementation of Failures
MacroPy accomplishes this by performing a wrapping a catch-all block around every macro invocation. This block intercepts the exception, and rather than allowing it to terminate the import process, serializes and returns a snippet in place of the expanded AST (the expansion failed afterall) that will re-raise the exception at run-time. This is what allows the magical transfer of exceptions from expansion-time to run-time, so they can be dealt with by normal means at the macro call-site instead of bubbling up from the import-site of the error-inducing file.

MacroPy also appends the expansion-time stack-trace of the exception onto the exception's `message`, providing much more information to help the programmer debug the problem. In order to avoid swamping the programmer with irrelevant details when the macro's failure is expected, MacroPy special cases macros of the form:

```python
AssertionError("...")
```

That is, `AssertionError`s with a non-empty `message`, to ignore the expansion-time stack trace and only provide the run-time stack trace when the exception is finally thrown. This means that the macro-writer can use statements like:

```python
assert False, "Can't have `%s` in body of enum" % unparse(stmt).strip("\n")
```

To provide friendly, custom error messages to the macro-user in the cases where the failure of the macro was anticipated.

Expansion Order
---------------
Macros are expanded in an outside-in order, with macros higher up in the AST being expanded before their children. Hence, if we have two macros inside each other, such as:

```python
from macropy.quick_lambda import macros, f
from macropy.tracing import macros, trace
trace[map(f[_ + 1], [1, 2, 3])]
# f[_ + 1] -> <function <lambda> at 0x00000000021F9128>
# _ + 1 -> 2
# _ + 1 -> 3
# _ + 1 -> 4
print map(f[_ + 1], [1, 2, 3]) -> [2, 3, 4]
# [2, 3, 4]
>>>
```

As you can see, the `trace` macro is expanded first, and hence the when it prints out the expressions being executed, we see the un-expanded `f[_ + 1]` rather than the expanded `(lammbda arg0: arg0 + 1)`. After the tracing is inserted, the `f` is finally expanded into a `lambda` and the final output of this expression is `[2, 3, 4]`.

If your macro needs to perform an operation *after* all macros in its sub-tree have been expanded, simply use the [expand_macros](#expand_macros) function on the sub-tree. This recursively expands all the macros in that sub-tree before returning, after which your macro can then do what it needs to do. The implementation of the `show_expanded` macro illustrates this:

```python
@macros.expr
def show_expanded(tree, expand_macros,  **kw):
    expanded_tree = expand_macros(tree)
    new_tree = hq[wrap_simple(unhygienic[log], u[unparse(expanded_tree)], ast[expanded_tree])]
    return new_tree
```

Line Numbers
------------
MacroPy makes a best-effort attempt to preserve the line numbers inside the macro-expanded code; generally, line numbers which are not within macros should be unchanged:

```python
# target.py
from my_macros import macros, expand

with expand:
    x = x + 1

raise Exception("lol")


# my_macros.py
from macropy.core.macros import *

macros = Macros()

@macros.block
def expand(tree, **kw):
    import copy
    return tree.body * 10
```

This prints

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "target.py", line 22, in <module>
    raise e
Exception: lol
```

As you can see, even though the line `x = x + 1` is expanded into 10 equivalent lines, the traceback for the `Exception("lol")` is unchanged. On the other hand, if the exception happens within the macro expanded code:

```python
#target.py
from macropy.core.test.macros.line_number_macro import macros, expand

y = 0
with expand:
    x = x - 1
    y = 1 / x
```

The error messages can be rather silly:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "target.py", line 2311, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```

Line 2311! In a 7 line file! This may improve in the future, but that's the current state of error reporting in MacroPy.

Discussion
==========
Writing macros is not easy, to say the least. Thus, although you could theoretically "do whatever the hell you want" when writing macros, you probably don't want to. Instead, you should [minimize](#minimize-macro-magic) what the macros do, [avoid them](#no-macros-necessary) entirely when not necessary, be concious of the amount of [magic](#levels-of-magic) you introduce and think hard about [what, exactly](#whither-macropy) you want to do with them.

Minimize Macro Magic
--------------------
This may seem counter-intuitive, but just because you have the ability to do AST transformations does not mean you should use it! In fact, you probably should do as little as is humanely possible in order to hand over control to traditional functions and objects, who can then take over.

For example, let us look at the [Parser Combinator](#parser-combinators) macro, shown in the examples above. You may look at the syntax:

```python
value = '[0-9]+'.r // int | ('(', expr, ')') // f[_[1]]
op = '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'
expr = (value is first, (op, value).rep is rest) >> reduce_chain([first] + rest)
```

And think this may be an ideal situation to go all-out, just handle the whole thing using AST transforms and do some code-generation to create a working parser! It turns out, the `peg` module does none of this. It has about 30 lines of code which does a very shallow transform from the above code into:

```python
value = Named(lambda: Raw('[0-9]+').r // int | Seq(Raw('('), expr, Raw(')')) // (lambda x: x[1]), "value")
op = Named(lambda: Raw('+') | Raw('-') | Raw('*') | Raw('/'), "op")
expr = Named(lambda: Seq(Named(lambda: value, "first"), Named(Seq(op, value).rep, "rest")) >> (lambda first, rest: reduce_chain([first] + rest)), "expr")
```

That's the extent of the macro! It just wraps the raw strings in `Raw`s, tuples in `Seq`s, converts the `a is b` syntax into `a.bind_to("b")` and wraps each assignement in a named, lazy parser to facilitate error reporting and to allow circular references between them. The rest, all the operators `|` `//` `>>`, the `.r` syntax for regexes and `.rep` syntax for repetitions, that's all just implemented on the `Raw` objects using plain-old operator overloading and properties.

Why do this, instead of simply implementing the behavior of `|` `//` and friends as macros? There are a few reasons

- **Maintainability**: tree transforms are messy, methods and operators are pretty simple. If you want to change what `.r` does, for example, you'll have a much easier time if it's a `@property` rather than some macro-defined transform
- **Consistency**: methods already have a great deal of pre-defined semantics built in: how the arguments are evaluated (eagerly, left to right, by-value), whether they can be assigned to or monkey-patched. All this behavior is what people already come to expect when programming in Python. By greatly limiting the macro transforms, you leave the rest up to the Python language which will behave as people expect.

It's not just the [Parser Combinators](#parser-combinators) which work like this; [PINQ](#pinq-to-sqlalchemy), [Tracing](#tracing), [Pattern Matching](#pattern-matching) all work like this, doing the minimal viable transform and delegating the functionality to objects and functions as soon as possible.

No Macros Necessary
-------------------
Python is a remarkably dynamic language. Not only that, but it is also a relatively *large* language, containing many things already built in. A large amount of feedback has been received from the online community, and among it suggestions to use macros for things such as:

- Before and After function advice: code snippets to hook into the function call process
- Auto parallelizing functions, which run in a forked process

This [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/764412/python-macros-use-cases) also explores the use cases of Macros in Python, and comes up with a large number of unimaginative suggestions:

- An `unless blah:` statement, equivalent to an `if not blah:`
- A `repeat` macro, to replace for-loops
- A `do while` loop

The last three examples are completely banal: they really don't add anything, don't make anything easier, and add a lot of indirection to no real gain. The first two suggestions, on the other hand, sound impressive, but are actually entirely implementable without Macros.

### Function Advice
Function advice, part of [AOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming), is a technique of register code snippets to run before or after function calls occur. These could be used for debugging (printing whenever a function is run), caching (intercepting the arguments and returning the value from a cache if it already exists), authentication (checking permissions before the function runs) and a host of other use cases.

Although in the Java world, such a technique requires high-sorcery with [AspectJ](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/) and other tools, in Python these are as simple as defining a decorator. For example, here is a decorator that logs invocations and returns of a generic python function:

```python
def trace(func):
    def new_func(*args, **kwargs):
        print "Calling", func.func_name, "with", args, kwargs
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print "func.func_name, "returned", result
        return result
    return new_func

@trace
my_func(arg0, arg1):
    ... do stuff ...
```

Similar things could be done for the other use cases mentioned. This is not a complete example (it would need a `functools.wraps` or similar to preserve the `argspec` etc.) but the point is that writing such a decorator really is not very difficult. No macros necessary!

### Auto-Parallelization
Another suggestion was to make a decorator macro that ships the code within the function into a separate process to execute. While this sounds pretty extreme, it really is not that difficult, for in Python you can easily introspect a function object and retrieve it's `code` attribute. This can pretty easily [be pickled and sent to a child process](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1253528/is-there-an-easy-way-to-pickle-a-python-function-or-otherwise-serialize-its-cod) to be executed there. Perhaps you may want some sort of Future container to hold the result, or some nice helpers for fork-join style code, but these are all just normal python functions: no macros necessary!

--------------------------------------

Thus, you can accomplish a lot of things in Python without using macros. If you need to pass functions around, you can do so without macros. Similarly, if you want to introspect a function and see how many arguments it takes, you can go ahead using `inspect`. `getattr`, `hasattr` and friends are sufficient for all sorts of reflective metaprogramming, dynamically setting and getting attributes. Beyond that, you have the abilities to access the `locals` an `globals` dictionaries, reflecting on the call stack via `inspect.stack()` and `eval` or `exec`ing source code. Whether this is a good idea is another question.

Levels of Magic
---------------
MacroPy is an extreme measure; there is no doubting that. Intercepting the raw source code as it is being imported, parsing it and performing AST transforms just before loading it is not something to be taken lightly! However, macros are not the most extreme thing that you can do! If you look at an Magic Scale for the various things you can do in Python, it may look something like this:

![Magic](docs/media/Magic.png)

Where basic language constructs are at **0** in the scale of magic, functions and classes can be mildly confusing. `hasattr` and `getattr` are at another level, letting you treat things objects as dictionaries and do all sorts of incredibly dynamic things.

I would place MacroPy about on par with Metaclasses in terms of their magic-level: pretty knotty, but still ok. Past that, you are in the realm of `stack.inspect()`, where your function call can look at *what files are in the call stack* and do different things depending on what it sees! And finally, at the **Beyond 9000** level of magic, is the act of piecing together code via string-interpolation or concatenation and just calling `eval` or `exec` on the whole blob, maybe at import time, maybe at run-time.

### Skeletons in the Closet
Many profess to shun the higher levels of magic "I would *never* do textual code generation!" you hear them say. "I will do things the simple, Pythonic way, with minimal magic!". But if you dig a little deeper, and see the code they use on a regular basis, you may notice some `namedtuple`s in their code base. Looking up the [implementation of namedtuple](http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/collections.py#l234) brings up this:

```python
template = '''class %(typename)s(tuple):
    '%(typename)s(%(argtxt)s)' \n
    __slots__ = () \n
    _fields = %(field_names)r \n
    def __new__(_cls, %(argtxt)s):
        'Create new instance of %(typename)s(%(argtxt)s)'
        return _tuple.__new__(_cls, (%(argtxt)s)) \n
    @classmethod
    def _make(cls, iterable, new=tuple.__new__, len=len):
```

Runtime code-generation as strings! It turns out they piece together the class declaration textually and then just `exec` the whole lot. Similar things take place in the new `Enum` that's going to enter the standard library. [Case Classes](#case-classes) may be magical, but are they really any worse than the status quo?

Beyond Python, you have the widely used [.NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework)'s [T4 Text Templates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) code-generation tools. This demonstrates that in any language, there will be situations where dynamic generation/compilation/execution of source code begin to look attractive, or even necessary. In these situations, syntactic macros provide a safer, easier to use and more maintainable alternative to this kind of string-trickery.

Whither MacroPy
---------------
When, then, do you need macros? We believe that the macros shown above are a compelling set of functionality that would be impossible without macros. The things that macros do roughly falls into the following categories:

- [Boilerplate Shaving](#boilerplate-shaving)
- [Source Reflection](#source-reflection)
- [Mobile Code](#mobile-code)

### Boilerplate Shaving
[Parser Combinators](#parser-combinators), [Quick Lambdas](#quick-lambdas) and [Case Classes](#case-classes) are examples _of boilerplate shaving_, where macros are used to reduce the amount of boilerplate necessary to perform some logic below the level that can be achieved by traditional means of abstraction (methods, operator overloading, etc.). With the Parser Combinators, for example, the macro transform that is performed is [extremely simple and superficial](#minimize-macro-magic). This is also the case with the other boilerplate shaving macros.

In these macros, the boilerplate that the macro removes is trivial but extremely important. Looking again at the [Parser Combinator](#minimize-macro-magic) transformation, it is clear that removing the boilerplate is a huge improvement: rather than having to dig through the code to figure out what happens, the PEG-like structure of the code jumps right out at you making it far easier to see, at a glance, what is going on.

### Source Reflection
Source reflection is the use of macros to take the source code of the program and making it available for inspection at run-time. For example, if we re-examine the error-reporting example from [MacroPEG](macropeg-parser-combinators):

```python
json_exp.parse('{"omg": "123", "wtf": , "bbq": "789"}')
# ParseError: index: 22, line: 1, col: 23
# json_exp / obj / pair / json_exp
# {"omg": "123", "wtf": , "bbq": "789"}
#                       ^
# expected: (obj | array | string | true | false | null | number)
```

We can see that MacroPEG is able to place the names of each parser in the `ParseError`'s error message. This of course is very handy when debugging your parsers, as well as being useful in debugging malformed input.

One question that you may ask is, how is MacroPEG able to access the names of each parser, given that the name of each parser is only provided in its variable name? Recall that MacroPEG parsers are defined as follows:

```python
with peg:
    json_exp = (space, (obj | array | string | true | false | null | number), space) // f[_[1]]
    obj = ...
    array = ...
    string = ...
    ...
```

The answer is that MacroPEG captures the variable-name of each parser and passes it to the parser's constructor, performing a transform similar to:

```python
obj = ... -> obj = Named(..., "obj")
```

By doing this, now you are able to get sensible error messages when using your parsers, without having to manually label each parser with a name in addition to the variable to which it's assigned.

Apart from MacroPEG, the [Tracing](#tracing) macros also operates on the same principle, capturing the source code of each snippet as a string that is passed to the code at run-time for printing. This is something which is impossible to do using normal Python code, and the only answer is the repetitive definition of each variable, statement or expression together with its string representation, a task which is extremely tedious to perform by hand.

### Mobile Code
Macros such as [PINQ](#pinq-to-sqlalchemy), [JS Snippets](#js-snippets), [Tracing](#tracing) and potential extensions such as the [Fork-Join](issues/25) macros are all about using macros to shuttle code between domains, while still allowing it to be written together in a single code base. PINQ and JS Snippets are all about taking sections of a Python program and executing it either on a remote database or in a browser, while the Tracing macro ships sections of code into the console for debugging purposes and the Fork-Join macro would shuttle sections of code between Python processes in order to run them in parallel.

This idea of _mobile code_ is not commonly seen in most domains; more often, code written in a single file is run in a single place, and if you want to write a distributed system, you'll need to manually break up your code even though conceptually it all belongs together. Allowing you to have a single code-base and semi-transparently (translucently?) ship the code to somewhere else to run would be a big step forward.

------------------------------

Note how none of these macros are simple things like do-while loops or alternate syntaxes for if-else statements; these categories of macros perform useful functions, often completely impossible without macros, and have to be carefully crafted so as to minimize the confusion caused by the macro transformation.

MacroPy: Bringing Macros to Python
==================================
Macros are always a contentious issue. On one hand, we have the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP) community, which seems to using macros for everything. On the other hand, most mainstream programmers shy away from them, believing them to be extremely powerful and potentially confusing, not to mention extremely difficult to execute.

With MacroPy, we believe that we have a powerful, flexible tool that makes it trivially easy to write AST-transforming macros with any level of complexity. We have a [compelling suite of use cases](#examples) demonstrating the utility of such transforms, and all of it runs perfectly fine on alternative implementations of Python such as PyPy.
