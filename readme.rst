**MacroPy** is an implementation of `Syntactic Macros
<http://tinyurl.com/cmlls8v>`_ in the `Python Programming Language
<http://python.org/>`_. MacroPy provides a mechanism for user-defined
functions (macros) to perform transformations on the `abstract syntax
tree <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`_ (AST) of a
Python program at *import time*. This is an easy way to enhance the
semantics of a Python program in ways which are otherwise impossible,
for example providing an extremely concise way of declaring classes.

Python like you've never seen before
====================================

MacroPy allows you to create constructs which are impossible to have
in normal python code, such as:

Tracing
-------

.. code:: python

    with trace:
        sum([x + 5 for x in range(3)])

    # sum([x + 5 for x in range(3)])
    # range(3) -> [0, 1, 2]
    # x + 5 -> 5
    # x + 5 -> 6
    # x + 5 -> 7
    # [x + 5 for x in range(3)] -> [5, 6, 7]
    # sum([x + 5 for x in range(3)]) -> 18

Quick Lambdas
-------------

.. code:: python

    print(list(map(f[_[0]], ['omg', 'wtf', 'bbq'])))
    # ['o', 'w', 'b']

    print(list(reduce(f[_ + _], ['omg', 'wtf', 'bbq'])))
    # 'omgwtfbbq

Case Classes
------------

.. code:: python

    @case
    class Point(x, y): pass

    p = Point(1, 2)

    print str(p)    #Point(1, 2)
    print p.x       #1
    print p.y       #2
    print Point(1, 2) == Point(1, 2) # True

and more! See the docs at
`<http://macropy3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Requirements
============

MacroPy3 is tested to run on `CPython 3.4
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython>`_ or newer and `PyPy
<http://pypy.org/>`_ 3.5. It has no current support for `Jython
<http://www.jython.org/>`_. MacroPy3 is also available on `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/macropy3>`_.

Installation
============

Just execute a:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install macropy3

if you want to use macros that require external libraries in order to
work, you can automatically install those dependencies by installing
one of the ``pinq`` or ``pyxl`` extras like this:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install macropy3[pinq,pyxl]


then have a look at the docs at `<http://macropy3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

How to contribute
=================

We're open to contributions, so send us your
ideas/questions/issues/pull-requests and we'll do our best to
accommodate you! You can ask questions on the `Google Group
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/macropy>`_  and on the
`Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/lihaoyi/macropy>`_ or file bugs on
thee `issues`__ page.

Credits
=======

MacroPy was initially created as a final project for the `MIT
<http://web.mit.edu/>`_ class `6.945: Adventures in Advanced Symbolic
Programming <http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/>`_,
taught by `Gerald Jay Sussman
<http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/>`_ and `Pavel Panchekha
<http://pavpanchekha.com/>`_. Inspiration was taken from project such
as `Scala Macros <http://scalamacros.org/>`_, `Karnickel
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/karnickel>`_ and `Pyxl
<https://github.com/dropbox/pyxl>`_.
